00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.433
Detection Methods

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.833
There are multiple methods that antivirus
manufacturers use

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:09.733
to detect malicious software.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:15.066
The most common methods used are
signature-based detection,

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:20.466
heuristic-based detection, and
behavioral-based detection.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.066
Signature-based antivirus detection is
mostly considered a blacklist technology.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.966
An antivirus signature is a continuous
sequence of bytes within malware

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.200
 that uniquely identifies it.

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:41.666
In other words, the filesystem is scanned
for known malware signatures and if any

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.266
are detected, the offending files are
quarantined.

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:50.000
With correct tools, we can bypass
signature-based detection

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.033
by simply changing or obfuscating the
contents of a known malicious file

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.600
 in order to break the identifying byte
sequence.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.133
To address the pitfalls of
signature-based detection,

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:06.766
antivirus manufacturers introduced
additional detection methods

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.933
to improve the effectiveness of their
products.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.300
Heuristic-Based Detection is a detection
method that relies on various rules and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.000
algorithms to determine whether or not an
action is considered malicious.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.300
This is often achieved by stepping
through the instruction set of a binary

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.666
file or by attempting to decompile and
then analyze the source code.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.266
The idea is to look for various patterns
and program calls,

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:43.600
as opposed to simple byte sequences, that 
are considered malicious.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:50.498
Alternatively, Behavior-Based Detection
dynamically analyzes the behavior

00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:52.300
 of a binary file.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.666
This is often achieved by executing the
file in question in an emulated

00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:01.766
environment, such as a small virtual
machine, and looking for behaviors

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:04.666
 or actions that are considered malicious.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.733
Since these techniques do not require a
malware signature,

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:14.722
they can be used to identify unknown
malware, or variations of known malware,

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:16.000
 more effectively.

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:21.466
Itâ€™s worth noting that the majority of
antivirus developers use a combination of

00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:25.733
these detection methods to achieve higher
detection rates.
