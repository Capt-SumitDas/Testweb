Wrapping Up

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:07.566
There are so many password attack tools
and wordlists available 

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:11.225
that it can be tempting to
just jump in and fire away

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:15.600
in search of that often-elusive break
during a penetration test.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.409
However, success lies in not only deeply
understanding the usage

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:22.506
 and strengths of each tool, 

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:27.233
but in learning to step back and apply
those tools with wisdom, 

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:30.616
honoring the balance of speed
and precision, 

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:35.400
as well as prioritizing the safety of the
clientâ€™s production environment.
