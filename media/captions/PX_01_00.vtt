00:00:01.304 --> 00:00:02.827
Information Gathering

00:00:03.723 --> 00:00:05.754
After compromising a target and gaining

00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:08.966
the initial foothold as
an unprivileged user,

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:14.233
our first step is to gather as much
information about our target as possible.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.746
This allows us to get a better
understanding of the configuration

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:19.766
of the machine we have compromised

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:23.766
and discover possible
privilege escalation vectors.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.630
In this section, we will explore
both manual and automated

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.033
information gathering and
enumeration techniques.
