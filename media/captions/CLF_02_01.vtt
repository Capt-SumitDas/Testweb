00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.086
Redirection to a New File

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:09.200
In the previous command examples,
the output was printed to the screen.

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.196
This is convenient most of the time,

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:18.203
but we can use the right-angle bracket
operator to save the output to a file

00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:21.503
to keep it for future reference
or manipulation.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.332
If we redirect the output to a
non-existent file,

00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:28.345
the file will be created automatically.

00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:34.558
However, if we save the output to
a file that already exists,

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.824
that fileâ€™s content will be replaced.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:44.406
Be very careful with redirection!
There is no undo function!
