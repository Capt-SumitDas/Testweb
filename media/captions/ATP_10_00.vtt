00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:02.200
Wrapping Up

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.100
In this course we have taken a journey
through many tunnels and shells.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.700
We started with only a hostname and
basic information about the target.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:22.294
We used our penetration testing skills to
obtain access to a Wordpress webserver 

00:00:22.294 --> 00:00:25.633
that later allowed us to
compromise a database. 

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:29.366
The database gave us a foothold
into the internal network

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:33.433
where we were able to obtain
access to a user’s workstation.

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:36.966
We escalated privileges on
the user’s workstation

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:40.133
and obtained information
about the domain.

00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:43.133
We then used our internal access

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.933
to gain a foothold on a
Jenkins development server.

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:50.433
Once we escalated our
privileges on the Jenkins server,

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:54.766
we found that a domain
administrator was also logged in.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.466
Finally, we impersonated
the domain administrator

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.200
to log in to the domain controller.

00:01:02.593 --> 00:01:06.433
During this journey, we learned
about the importance of enumeration,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.535
the real-world difficulties of
tunneling, and many other

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:15.533
valuable lessons that apply
to real-world penetration tests.
