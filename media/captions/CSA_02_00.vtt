00:00:01.175 --> 00:00:04.175
Leveraging HTML Applications

00:00:05.854 --> 00:00:09.654
Next, we will turn our attention
to specific client-side attacks,

00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:14.100
beginning with an attack
against HTML Applications.

00:00:15.183 --> 00:00:20.183
HTML Applications allow arbitrary
execution of applications

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:22.716
directly from Internet Explorer,

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.854
rather than downloading and
manually running an executable.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:33.829
If a file is created with the
extension of .hta instead of .html,

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.395
Internet Explorer will automatically
interpret it as an HTML Application

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.854
and offer to execute it using
the mshta.exe program.

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:49.354
Since this clashes with the security
boundaries in Internet Explorer,

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:53.187
an HTML Application is
always executed

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.300
outside of the security
context of the browser

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.900
by the Microsoft-signed
binary mshta.exe.

00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:07.141
If the user allows this to happen, an
attacker can execute arbitrary code

00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:11.708
with that userâ€™s permissions,
avoiding the security restrictions

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:14.275
normally imposed by Internet Explorer.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:18.483
While this attack vector only
works against Internet Explorer

00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:22.783
and to some extent Microsoft Edge,
it is still useful

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:28.362
since many corporations rely on Internet
Explorer as their default browser.

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:35.175
This vector leverages features directly
built into Windows operating systems and,

00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:38.641
more importantly, it is
compatibile with less-secure

00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:42.908
Microsoft legacy web
technologies such as ActiveX.
