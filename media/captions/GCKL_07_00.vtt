Wrapping Up

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.366
In this module we set a baseline for the 
upcoming modules.

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.033
We explored tips and tricks for new 
users

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:15.800
and reviewed some standards that more
advanced users may appreciate. 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.700
All students are encouraged to review 
the free online training

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.666
on the Kali Training site.

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.000
This site includes the Kali Linux Revealed
book,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.733
excercizes designed to test your 
understanding, 

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.766
a dedicated support forum, and more.

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:36.933
These free resources provide valuable 
insight to users of all skill levels

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:41.766
and serve as an excellent companion 
to the training presented in this course.
