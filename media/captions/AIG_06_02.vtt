00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.066
Scanning for SNMP

00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:09.400
To scan for open SNMP ports,
we can turn once again to nmap.

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:19.133
The -sU option is used
to perform UDP scanning

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:25.333
and the –open option is used to limit
the  output to only display open ports.

00:00:29.064 --> 00:00:32.300
Alternatively, we can use a tool
such as onesixtyone,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.833
which will attempt a brute force attack
against a list of IP addresses.

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:43.300
First we need to build text files
containing community strings…

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:48.033
…and the IP addresses we wish to scan.

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:59.300
We pass our community strings to
onesixyone with the -c option…

00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:04.233
…and the IP addresses
to scan with the -i option.

00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:09.766
Once we find SNMP services,

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:14.366
we can start querying them for specific
MIB data that might be interesting.
