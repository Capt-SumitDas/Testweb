00:00:00.773 --> 00:00:04.700
Assembling the Pieces:
Penetration Test Breakdown 

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:09.433
Now that we have introduced all the
individual pieces of a penetration test,

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:11.866
it’s time to put them together.

00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:16.100
In this module, we’ll conduct
a simulated penetration test

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.100
inspired by real-world findings.

00:00:20.273 --> 00:00:21.273
During this penetration test,

00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:25.400
we will alternate between
enumeration and exploitation.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.733
We will also review commonly-made mistakes

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:33.833
and discuss why it is not always
necessary to obtain root on a target.

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:39.200
Our fictitious client has
provided us an initial target

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.700
named “sandbox.local”

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.700
and revealed that a compromised
domain administrator account

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.133
would have a devastating
impact on their business.

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:56.900
This domain is accessible via the PWK VPN

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.200
but requires us to add an
entry to our /etc/hosts file.

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:05.066
First, we’ll make a backup
of the existing file.

00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:14.166
Now we’ll append an entry that will allow
us to contact the domain via its DNS name.

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:20.833
Great, let’s continue.
