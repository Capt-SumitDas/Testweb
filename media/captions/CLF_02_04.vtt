00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.869
Redirecting Standard Error

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:07.011
According to the POSIX specification,

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:12.799
the file descriptors for Standard Input,
Standard Output, and Standard Error

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.908
are defined as zero, one,
and two respectively.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.683
These numbers are important as they can be
used to manipulate the corresponding

00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:23.850
data streams from the command line

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.678
while executing or joining different
commands together.

00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:31.017
To get a better grasp of how the file
descriptor numbers work,

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:34.859
consider this example which redirects
the standard error.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:45.464
Note that error.txt only contains the
error message generated on Standard Error.

00:00:45.464 --> 00:00:50.564
We did this by prepending the stream
number to the right-angle bracket operator

00:00:50.564 --> 00:00:54.000
where 2 corresponds to Standard Error.
