Identifying XSS Vulnerabilities

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:09.500
We can find potential entry points for XSS

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.933
by examining a web application
and identifying input fields

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:18.366
(such as search fields) that
accept unsanitized input,

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:22.600
which is displayed as output
in subsequent pages.

00:00:23.553 --> 00:00:28.033
Once we identify an entry point,
we can input special characters,

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:29.708
and observe the output

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:33.566
to see if any of the special
characters return unfiltered.

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.433
If the application does not remove
or encode these characters,

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:40.966
it may be vulnerable to XSS

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:45.233
as the characters can be used
to introduce code into the page.

00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:49.366
If we can inject these special
characters into the page,

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.633
the browser will treat
them as code elements.

00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:58.433
We can then begin to build code that
will be executed in the victimâ€™s browser.
