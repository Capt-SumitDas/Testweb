00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:02.699
watch

00:00:03.432 --> 00:00:08.399
The watch command is used to run a
designated command at regular intervals.

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.399
By default, it runs every two seconds

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:16.244
but we can specify a different interval
by using the -n X option

00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:19.344
to have it run every “X” number of seconds.

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:23.590
For example, this command will
list logged-in users

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.023
(output from the w command) once
every 5 seconds:

00:00:28.753 --> 00:00:32.320
To terminate the watch command and
return to the interactive terminal,

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.299
use control-c
