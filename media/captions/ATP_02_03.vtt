00:00:01.496 --> 00:00:03.333
Cracking the Password

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:06.033
Now that we have the password hash,

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:09.633
we will need to crack it to
get the plaintext password.

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:17.933
Instead of running a brute force attack,

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:23.066
we use the “rockyou” wordlist,
which is included in Kali Linux.

00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:29.033
Before we continue, let’s create a file
containing the password hash…

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.195
…and attempt to crack the password

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:35.800
with John the Ripper.

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:42.400
We will use the –wordlist option
along with the path to our wordlist,

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.700
and provide the filename
that contains the password hash.

00:00:50.608 --> 00:00:54.433
It appears that John the Ripper has cracked the password.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:58.466
Let’s try to log in to the
web application with this password.

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:08.200
We’ll browse the default
WordPress login page at /wp-admin…

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:14.291
and attempt to log in

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.333
as the wp_ajla_admin user
with the password we discovered.

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:27.233
The credentials worked.

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.133
We're presented with
the admin dashboard.

00:01:30.638 --> 00:01:33.966
Now that we are logged in,
we can continue our enumeration

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.366
to discover our next attack vector.
