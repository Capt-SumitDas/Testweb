00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.300
Forward Lookup Brute Force

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.400
Brute force is a trial-and-error technique
that seeks to find valid information,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.866
including directories on a webserver,

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:17.866
username and password combinations,
or in this case, valid DNS records.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.800
By using a wordlist that contains common hostnames,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.400
we can attempt to guess DNS records

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.366
and check the response for valid hostnames.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.733
In the examples so far,
we used forward lookups,

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.633
which request the
IP address of a hostname,

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:38.333
to query both a valid
and an invalid hostname.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.766
If host successfully resolves
a name to an IP,

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:46.000
this could be an indication
of a functional server.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.966
We can automate the forward DNS
lookup of common hostnames

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.533
using the host command
in a Bash one-liner.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:01:01.166
We will use this short list of potential
hostnames for demonstration purposes.

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:09.466
Our one-liner will loop through our
list and attempt to resolve each hostname.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.866
With this simplified wordlist,
we discovered entries for

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.133
“www”, “mail”, and “router”.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.600
The hostnames “ftp”, “owa”, and
“proxy”, however, were not found.

00:01:27.464 --> 00:01:32.366
Much more comprehensive wordlists are
available as part of the SecLists project,

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.766
which can be installed with apt.
