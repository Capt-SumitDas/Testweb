00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.133
Targeting the Domain Controller

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:11.633
At this point, we have compromised
two Linux servers, Ajla and Zora.

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:17.800
Using Zora’s internal network access,
we were able to pivot to Poultry.

00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:23.433
This host allowed us to get an initial
look into the internal domain.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:28.600
From here, we compromised Cevapi
and we just impersonated

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.700
the sandbox administrator’s
token on Cevapi.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.033
Now we need to use the impersonation to
obtain access to the domain controller.
