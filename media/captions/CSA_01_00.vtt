00:00:01.287 --> 00:00:02.720
Know Your Target

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:08.541
From an attackerâ€™s standpoint, the primary
difficulty with client-side attacks

00:00:08.554 --> 00:00:12.454
lies in enumeration of the
victimâ€™s client software.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.187
The secret to success in
client-side attacks is,

00:00:16.187 --> 00:00:19.420
as with most things related
to penetration testing,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.687
accurate and thorough
information gathering.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.466
We can use both passive and active
information gathering techniques

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.666
against our client-side attack targets.
