00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.666
The Metasploit Framework

00:00:05.716 --> 00:00:08.950
Working with public exploits
can often be difficult.

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:14.183
They must be modified to fit each scenario
and tested for malicious code.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.975
Each exploit uses a unique
command-line syntax,

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:22.200
and there is no standardization
in coding practices or languages.

00:00:23.158 --> 00:00:26.825
In addition, there are a variety of
post-exploitation tools,

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:31.691
auxiliary tools, and numerous attack
techniques that must be considered

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:34.758
in even the most basic attack scenarios.

00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:39.808
Exploit frameworks aim to address
some or all of these issues.

00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:43.058
Although they vary somewhat
in form and function,

00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:48.275
each framework aims to consolidate and
streamline the process of exploitation

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:54.041
by offering a variety of exploits, 
simplifying the usage of these exploits,

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.883
easing lateral movement,

00:00:55.883 --> 00:01:00.050
and assisting with the management
of compromised infrastructure.

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:04.775
Most of these frameworks offer
dynamic payload capabilities,

00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:07.766
which means that for each exploit
in the framework,

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.641
we can choose various
payloads to deploy.

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:15.700
Over the past few years, several
exploit and post-exploitation

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.766
frameworks have been developed.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:21.291
While many of these frameworks
are commercial offerings,

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:26.100
the Metasploit Framework is open-source,
and is the focus of this module.

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:31.066
The project initially started off
as a portable network game

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:34.841
and has evolved into a powerful
tool for penetration testing,

00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:38.691
exploit development, and
vulnerability research.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.216
Newcomers to the Metasploit
Framework are often overwhelmed

00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:46.941
by the multitude of features
and use-cases it offers.

00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:53.058
The Metasploit Framework is valuable in
almost every phase of a penetration test,

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:57.391
including passive and active
information gathering,

00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.025
vulnerability research and development,

00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:05.025
client-side attacks, post-exploitation,
and much more.

00:02:05.683 --> 00:02:10.116
With such overwhelming capability,
itâ€™s easy to get lost.

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:13.325
Fortunately, Metasploit
is well-thought-out

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:16.900
and offers a unified
and sensible interface.

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:22.275
In this module, we will provide a
walkthrough of the Metasploit Framework,

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:28.866
including features and usage along with
some explanation of its inner workings.
