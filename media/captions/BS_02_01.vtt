00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.300
Arguments


00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.266
Not all Bash scripts require arguments 
but it is extremely important to

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.866
understand how they are interpreted by 
Bash and how to use them.


00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.600
We’ve already executed Linux commands with arguments.


00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.633
For example, when we run ls -l /var/log…
 

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:28.000
…both -l and /var/log are arguments to 
the ls command.


00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:33.133
Bash scripts are no different–we can 
supply command-line arguments and 


00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.100
use them in our scripts.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.133
This simple script uses echo to display 
a string.


00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:47.634
The $1 and $2 variables represent the 
first and second arguments passed 


00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:49.200
to the script.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:56.400
In addition, $0 refers to the name of the
script itself.

00:00:56.497 --> 00:01:01.331
Let’s give our script executable 
permissions and run it while providing

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:02.321
two arguments.


00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:09.200
As expected, our script runs and Bash 
echoes the two arguments we provided.


00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:14.400
There are a number of other special Bash 
variables, 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.933
like dollar question mark to display 
the exit status of the last process…

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.800
…and $RANDOM, which generates a random 
number.


00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.900
Refer to your lab guide for other 
special Bash variables that you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.266
 can use in your scripts.
