Wrapping Up

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:08.433
In this module, we have provided
an overview and some insight

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:12.866
into Active Directory and
its associated security.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.266
While we covered many techniques, there
are many others worth exploring.

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:21.433
Depending on the security
posture of the client,

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:25.566
it is also worth putting some
thought into avoiding detection

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:30.300
and not blindly executing every
command and technique,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.666
as we paid little attention to operational
security in these examples.
