00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.873
Selecting the Vulnerability

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:07.133
Letâ€™s consider the following scenario.

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:10.566
During an assessment
we discover a Linux host

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.833
 that has an apache2 server exposed.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:20.233
After enumerating the web server we find
an installation of CMS Made Simple

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.700
version 2.2.5

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.533
 listening on port 443.

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:28.666
This version appears to be vulnerable
to remote code execution

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:32.933
and a public exploit is
available on Exploit-DB.

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:36.366
This vulnerability is post-authentication,

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:40.233
however, we discovered valid
application credentials

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:43.933
on another machine during
the enumeration process.
