Interacting with a DNS Server

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.433
Each domain can use
different types of DNS records

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.033
and due to the wealth of information
contained within DNS,

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:15.933
it’s often a lucrative target
for active information gathering.

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:22.300
To demonstrate this,
we’ll use the host command

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.900
to find the IP address of
www.megacorpone.com

00:00:31.444 --> 00:00:35.733
By default, the host command
looks for an A host record,

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:41.433
but what if we wanted to find the MX or
perhaps some interesting TXT records?

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:47.533
To do this, we can use the -t option

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.400
to specify the type of
record we are looking for.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.733
For example,

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.866
to find the servers that handle
email for the domain,

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.333
we search for the mx records.

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.200
DNS text records can contain
any type of arbitrary data

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.500
and are often worth investigating.
