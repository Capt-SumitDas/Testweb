Client-Side Attacks

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.579
The Metasploit Framework
also offers many features

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:13.333
that assist with client-side attacks,
including various executable formats

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.000
beyond those we have already explored.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:19.566
We can review some of
these executable formats with the

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.766
-l formats option of msfvenom

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:36.533
The hta-psh, vba, and vba-psh formats,

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:40.266
are designed for use
in client-side attacks

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:44.233
by creating either a
malicious HTML Application

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:51.033
or an Office macro for use in a Word or
Excel document, respectively.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:59.000
The MSF also contains
many browser exploits.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.366
For example, we can search for “flash” to
display multiple Flash-based exploits.

00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:15.133
While the exploits are verified and most
are stable, they are also somewhat

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:19.500
dated due to the increasing challenges
of developing browser exploits.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.133
If we discover a target running an older
operating system like Windows 7

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:31.766
with an unpatched browser, this type
of vector may provide the opening we need.
