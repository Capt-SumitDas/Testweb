Wrapping Up

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:06.333
In this module, we covered the
basic syntax and functionality

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.333
of PowerShell Empire,

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:11.966
such as listeners, stagers, and agents.

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:18.733
We also explored various modules
to perform enumeration,

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:22.500
obtain credentials,
and perform lateral movement.

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:28.566
Lastly, we looked at how PowerShell Empire
and Metasploit can be used together.
