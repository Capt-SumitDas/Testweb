00:00:01.226 --> 00:00:04.226
Unauthenticated Scanning With Nessus

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:11.133
To launch the scan, we will click the
arrow next to Save and then click Launch.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:22.100
Initially, the scan will
have a status of Running.

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:30.166
Once the scan is finished,
the status will change to Completed.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.700
The scan time will vary based on many
factors including the scan configuration

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.533
and the speed of the network.

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:43.166
From the “My Scans” screen,
we can click on the scan name

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.733
to show the list of hosts
discovered during the scan

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:50.166
and the breakdow of
potential vulnerabilities.

00:00:50.502 --> 00:00:52.800
Whether we scan one host or many,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.900
we can click on an IP address or hostname

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.466
to display the vulnerabilities
discovered for that target.

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:05.666
We can filter these
vulnerabilities by severity,

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.166
exploitability,

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.166
CVE, and more.

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:14.300
To display the vulnerabilities that will
most likely lead to target compromise,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.633
we can click on the filter dropdown
and select “Exploit Available”.

00:01:25.717 --> 00:01:29.000
We’ll accept the rest of
the defaults and click Apply.

00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:34.800
This will display a
list of vulnerabilities

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.966
in groups that are defined by Nessus.

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.500
While this grouping can be useful,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.633
we will click the gear icon
at the top right of the table,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.466
and select “Disable Groups”.

00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:57.966
This lists all vulnerabilities on
a single page, sorted by severity.

00:01:58.294 --> 00:02:01.400
This output format is
perfect for our purposes

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.866
as it displays a kind of roadmap to
potential compromise of the target,

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:09.266
with highest-risk vulnerabilities
displayed first.

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:13.333
Of course, some of the entries
may represent false positives,

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.366
which is why it is critical
to review the scan data

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:19.266
and manually test the scan results.
