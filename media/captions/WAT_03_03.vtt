00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.600
Nikto

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:07.566
Nikto is a highly configurable
Open Source web server scanner

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:11.800
that tests for thousands of
dangerous files and programs,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.866
vulnerable server versions,

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.633
and various server configuration issues.

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:20.300
It performs well, but is
not designed for stealth

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.933
as it will send many requests and
embed information about itself

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.966
in the User-Agent header.

00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:30.766
Nikto can scan multiple servers and ports

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.900
and will scan as many
pages as it can find.

00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:37.700
On sites with heavy content,
such as an ecommerce site,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.400
a Nikto scan can take
several hours to complete.

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:45.800
We have two options to
control the scan duration.

00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:50.200
The simplest option is to
set the maxtime option,

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:54.100
which will halt the scan after
the specified time limit.

00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.866
This does not optimize
the scan in any way.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.466
Nikto will simply stop scanning.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:06.933
Our second option is to tune the scan
with the -T option.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:11.966
We can use this feature to control
which types of tests we want to run.

00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:16.633
There are times when we don’t want
to run all the tests built in to Nikto,

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:21.133
such as when verifying the existence
of a certain class of vulnerability.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.966
Tuning a scan is invaluable
in these situations.

00:01:25.727 --> 00:01:29.200
Nikto is especially useful for
catching low-hanging fruit,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.190
reporting non-standard
server headers,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.000
and catching server configuration errors.

00:01:35.413 --> 00:01:39.366
To demonstrate this, let’s run Nikto
against www.megacorpone.com.

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:46.500
We’ll specify the host we
want to scan with -host,

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:49.066
and for the sake of this demonstration,

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:52.266
we’ll limit the scan
duration to 30 seconds.

00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.866
Although we limited the scan duration,

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:04.366
the output still provided
some interesting information.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:09.400
For example, it identified that the
version of Apache running on the server

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.200
is out of date and past its end-of-life.

00:02:14.427 --> 00:02:17.866
We have only demonstrated
a fraction of the tools

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:20.800
available in Kali Linux in
this brief introduction,

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.833
but the tools we have covered
so far will serve us well

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:27.300
for the demonstrations that
follow in the rest of the module.
