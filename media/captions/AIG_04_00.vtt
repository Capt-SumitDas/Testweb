NFS Enumeration

00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:08.566
NFS is a distributed file system protocol

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.333
that allows a user on a client computer

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.100
to access files over a computer network

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.866
as if they were on
locally-mounted storage.

00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.800
NFS is often used with UNIX
operating systems and is generally

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.066
insecure in its implementation.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.500
It can be somewhat difficult
to set up securely,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.700
so itâ€™s not uncommon to find
NFS shares open to the world.

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.500
This is quite convenient for us as penetration testers,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.766
as we might be able to leverage these
shares to collect sensitive information,

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.800
escalate our privileges, and so forth.
