Fixing Web Exploits

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:09.766
Web application vulnerabilities do not
often result in memory corruption.

00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:12.433
This means that they are not affected

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:15.333
by protections provided
by the operating system

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.666
such as DEP and ASLR

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.333
and they are significantly
easier to re-purpose.
