00:00:01.536 --> 00:00:03.600
Traditional Approach

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:08.533
The first technique, which we’ll
refer to as the “traditional” approach,

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:12.800
uses the built-in net.exe application.

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:17.100
Specifically, we will use the
net user sub-command,

00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:23.433
which enumerates all local accounts.

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:30.700
Adding the /domain flag…

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.433
will enumerate all users
in the entire domain.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.666
Once we have a list of users, we can
query information about individual users.

00:00:42.902 --> 00:00:46.566
Based on the output, we should
query the jeff_admin user

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.100
since the name sounds promising.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.433
jeff_admin is a member of the Domain
Admins group, which is noteworthy.

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:05.833
In order to enumerate all
groups in the domain

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:10.033
we’ll add the /domain flag
to the net group command:

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:17.266
From the output we notice the
custom groups Secret_Group,

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:21.133
Nested_Group, and
Another_Nested_Group.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.466
In Active Directory, a group,
and all its included members,

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:32.400
can be added as member to another group.
This is known as a nested group.

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:37.900
While nesting may seem confusing,
it scales well due to its flexibility

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.300
even in the largest AD implementations.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:45.900
Unfortunately, the net.exe
command line tool cannot list

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.500
nested groups and only shows
the direct user members.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.066
Due to this and other limitations, we
will explore a more flexible alternative

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:01.733
that is more effective in
larger real-world environments.
