Pastebin

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Pastebin is a website for storing and
sharing text.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.600
The site doesn’t require an account for
basic usage.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.633
Many people use Pastebin because it is
ubiquitous and simple to use.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.266
But since Pastebin is a public service,

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.933
we can use it to search for sensitive
information.

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.700
For example, we can use the website for
basic searches,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.733
or use the API for more advanced uses.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.366
Let’s search for megacorpone.com

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.433
There are only a small number of results,

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:47.000
but some of them look very familiar.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.766
We might not find any new information here
on MegaCorp One but we shouldn't

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:56.700
overlook searching Pastbin on future
information gathering efforts.
