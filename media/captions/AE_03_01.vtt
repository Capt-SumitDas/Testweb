On-Disk Evasion

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.233
To begin our discussion of evasion, we
will first look

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:14.333
at four techniques used to obfuscate
files stored on a physical disk.

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:21.033
One of the earliest ways of avoiding
detection involved the use of packers.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.733
Packers generate an executable that is not only smaller,

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:31.533
but is also functionally equivalent
with a completely new binary structure.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.966
The resultant file has a new signature
and as a result,

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:41.166
can effectively bypass older and more
simplistic AV scanners.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:47.366
Obfuscators reorganize and mutate code

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:51.100
 in a way that makes it more difficult
to reverse-engineer.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:56.266
This includes replacing instructions with
semantically equivalent ones,

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:59.966
inserting irrelevant instructions or
“dead code”,

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:03.766
splitting or reordering functions, and
so on.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.800
“Crypter” software cryptographically
alters executable code,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.966
adding a decrypting stub that restores
the original code upon execution.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:24.300
This decryption happens in-memory,
leaving only the encrypted code on-disk,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.233
all but invisible to signature detection.

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:31.600
Encryption has become foundational in
modern malware

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.233
as one of the most effective AV evasion
techniques.

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:40.733
Highly effective antivirus evasion
requires a combination of all of these

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:46.200
techniques in addition to other advanced
ones, including anti-reversing,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.366
anti-debugging, virtual machine emulation
detection and so on.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:58.300
In most cases, software protectors were
designed for legitimate purposes

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.900
but can also be used to bypass AV
detection.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.533
Most of these techniques may appear
simple at a high-level,

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.966
but they are actually quite complex.

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:13.400
