00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:02.591
vi

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:06.425
Vi is an extremely powerful
text editor,

00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:11.825
capable of blazing speed especially when
it comes to automating repetitive tasks.

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:12.958
However,

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.425
it has a relatively steep
learning curve

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:18.558
and is nowhere near as simple
to use as Nano.

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:23.247
Due to its complexity, we will only
cover the very basics here.

00:00:23.503 --> 00:00:29.069
As with nano, to edit a file, simply
pass its name as an argument to vi.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.236
Once the file is opened, enable
insert-text mode to begin typing.

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:39.369
To do this, press the “i” key and
start typing away.

00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:44.325
To disable insert-text mode and go
back to command mode,

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:45.958
press the Escape key.

00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:51.069
While in command mode, use dd to
delete the current line.

00:00:51.114 --> 00:00:54.147
Press yy to copy the current line…

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:57.947
And press p to paste the
clipboard contents.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:02.591
To delete the current character under
the cursor, press the x key.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.014
To write the current file to disk and
remain in vi, type colon-w.

00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:13.425
Type colon-q

00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:18.192
follwed by an exclamation mark to quit
without writing the file to disk.

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:21.747
To quickly save the file and quit vi,

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:26.036
enter :wq!.

00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:33.436
Because vi seems so awkward to use,
many users avoid it.

00:01:33.758 --> 00:01:36.692
However, from a penetration tester’s
point of view,

00:01:36.692 --> 00:01:41.125
vi can save a great deal of time in
the hands of an experienced user,

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:44.758
and is installed on every
POSIX-compliant system.
