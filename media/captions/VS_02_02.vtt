Defining Targets

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.066
Once Nessus is installed,
it’s time to set up our first scan.

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:13.266
To begin, we simply click
the “New Scan” button.

00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:17.066
Nessus supports a number
of different scan types.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.900
We recommend investigating these scan
types, but for this introductory section,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.466
we will focus on a standard,
basic network scan,

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:29.566
which we can launch
by clicking on “Basic Network Scan”.

00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:37.133
The scan configuration settings screen
has two required arguments:

00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:41.666
 a name for our scan
and a list of targets.

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:46.200
Nessus supports adding targets as an IP address,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.933
an IP range,

00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:50.633
or as a comma-delimited list.

00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:55.933
For this example, we will scan the
Gamma machine in the PWK labs.

00:00:56.093 --> 00:00:59.833
We will enter “Gamma - Basic”
into the Name field

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.333
and the IP address into the Targets field:
