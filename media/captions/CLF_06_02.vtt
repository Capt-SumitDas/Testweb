Jobs Control: jobs and fg

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:08.889
To quickly check on the status
of our ICMP echo requests, 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.922
we need to make use of two additional
commands: jobs and fg.

00:00:14.212 --> 00:00:18.679
Let’s begin by starting and suspending
two long-running commands.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.966
The built-in jobs utility

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.766
lists the jobs that are running
in the current terminal session.

00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:36.845
Running the fg command

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:39.712
followed by a percent sign
and job number

00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:41.979
returns a job to the foreground.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:47.279
We’ll use ctrl-c to terminate this
ping process and run jobs again.

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:51.399
With only one job running,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.443
we can run fg without any additional
arguments to return it to the foreground.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.056
Specific jobs can also be referenced
by their process ID number

00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:04.756
or command name
