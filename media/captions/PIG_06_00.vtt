00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.433
Open-Source Code

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:10.466
In the following sections, we will discuss
various online tools and resources

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:14.133
that can be used to passively search for
information.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.866
One such source of interesting information
are open-source projects and online code

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:26.233
repositories, such as GitHub, GitLab, and
SourceForge.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.966
Code stored online can provide a glimpse
into the programming languages

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.766
and frameworks used by an organization.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.433
In some rare occassions, developers have
even accidentally committed sensitive data

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.133
and credentials to public repos.

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:46.566
The search tools for some of these
platforms will support the Google Hacking

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.966
search operators that we discussed
earlier in this module.

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:58.300
For example, GitHub’s search is very
flexible.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:09.566
On GitHub, we will be able to search a
user’s or organization’s repos,

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:14.400
but we need an account if we want to
search across all public repos.

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:18.766
Let’s assume that we identified MegaCorp
One’s GitHub account.

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:27.133
We can search the account’s repos for
interesting information.

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:31.266
In this case, we’ll use filename:users

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:35.700
to search for any files with the word
“users” in the name.

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:48.866
Our search only found one file -
xampp.users.

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:54.333
Even with a single result, we may have
found something very interesting

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:58.966
as XAMPP is a web application development
environment.

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.766
Let’s check the contents of the file.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.633
This file appears to contain a username
and password hash

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:17.100
that could be very useful when we begin
our active attack phase.

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:22.533
This manual approach will work best on
small repos.

00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:27.600
For larger repos, we can use several tools
to help automate some of the searching,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.366
such as Gitrob and Gitleaks.

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:35.833
Recon-ng also has several modules for
searching GitHub.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.600
Most of these tools require an access
token

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.066
to use the source code hosting provider’s
API.
