Practical Tools

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.655
The modern security professional
has access to a wide variety

00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:10.222
of advanced tools unimaginable
a few short years ago.

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:14.971
However, we often find ourselves in
situations where the only tools available

00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:18.237
are the tools already installed on
the target machine.

00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:21.925
Other times, we might only be
able to transfer small files

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:24.758
to expand our foothold on
the target network.

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:29.989
For these reasons, itâ€™s vital to have a
good understanding of some practical tools

00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:37.643
Often-used tools include Netcat, Socat,
PowerShell, Wireshark, and Tcpdump.
