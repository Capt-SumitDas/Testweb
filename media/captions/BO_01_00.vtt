00:00:01.296 --> 00:00:04.330
Introduction to the x86 Architecture

00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:08.463
To understand how memory
corruptions occur,

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:11.796
and how they can be leveraged
into unauthorized access,

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:14.396
we need to discuss program memory,

00:00:14.763 --> 00:00:18.230
understand how software
works at the CPU level,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.430
and outline a few basic definitions.
