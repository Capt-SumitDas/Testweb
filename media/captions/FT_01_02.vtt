Installing Pure-FTPd

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.433
In order to accommodate the 
vvexercises in this module,

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:13.700
let’s quickly install the Pure-FTPd 
server on our Kali attack machine.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:30.066
Before any clients can connect to 
our FTP server, 

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.966
we need to create a new user for 
Pure-FTPd.

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:41.966
This Bash script will automate the user 
creation for us.

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.933
It creates the relevant group and user, 

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:49.500
configures folder permissions, and starts 
the FTP server.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.833
We’ll make the script executable, 
then run it…

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:04.433
and we’ll enter “lab” as the password for 
the offsec user when prompted.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:11.933
Now that our FTP server is installed and 
configured, we can continue.
