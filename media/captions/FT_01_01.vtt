Dangers of Transferring Attack Tools

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:10.033
In some cases, we may need to transfer 
attack tools and utilities to our target.

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:14.566
However, transferring these tools can be 
dangerous for several reasons.

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:19.533
First, our post-exploitation attack tools 
could be abused by malicious parties, 

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.566
which puts the clientâ€™s resources at risk.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:27.400
Second, antivirus software, which scans 
endpoint filesystems

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.833
in search of pre-defined file signatures, 


00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:33.466
becomes a huge frustration for us 
during this phase.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:37.400
As a general rule of thumb, we should 
always try to use native tools 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.466
on the compromised system.

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:44.600
Alternatively, we can upload additional 
tools when native ones are insufficient, 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.900
when we have determined that the 
risk of detection is minimized, 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.800
or when our need outweighs the risk of 
detection.
