Passive Client Information Gathering

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.500
When leveraging passive information
gathering techniques,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.500
we do not directly interact
with our intended targets.

00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:18.737
For example, in a recent engagement we
were tasked with attempting to compromise

00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:24.325
corporate employees with client-side
attacks and various phishing techniques.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:29.958
However, we were not allowed to
make phone contact with employees.

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:31.450
Given that restriction, 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.016
we Googled for various known
external corporate IP addresses

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:41.250
and found one on a site that
hosts collected user agent data

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:43.375
from various affiliate sites.

00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:46.979
This information, similar to
that shown in this screenshot,

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.012
revealed the underlying operating system
version of a corporate client machine:

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.166
It also revealed the browser type
and version along with installed plugins

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.079
as listed in the User Agent string.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.766
We modified an existing exploit and
launched it against one of our lab machines

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:11.066
running the same operating system
and browser version as our target.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.162
The test was a success

00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:18.062
so we used the exploit in a client-side
attack against our corporate target

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.320
and were rewarded with
a reverse shell.

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:28.208
We can find this type of information
fairly often, on websites, in IRC logs

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.487
and even in photos
posted to social media.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.700
Time spent doing research is never wasted.
