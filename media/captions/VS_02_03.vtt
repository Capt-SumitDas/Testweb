00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.733
Configuring Scan Definitions

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.600
In this scenario, we have selected the
Basic Network Scan template definition

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.566
which, like all other templates,

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.800
comes preconfigured with default settings.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.000
However, these defaults might not be
exactly what we are looking for

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.933
and we must take into consideration
our environment,

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.566
our time constraints,

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.833
and the target that will be scanned.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:31.966
For this scan, we want to run an
initial basic port scan against ALL ports.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:37.333
By default, the Basic Network Scan
will only scan the common ports.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.966
To change this, we click the Discovery
link on the left side of the Settings tab.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.133
From the “Scan Type” dropdown,
we’ll change the value to “Custom”.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:53.933
This will add additional configurations
under Discovery.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.833
Now we’ll click on “Port Scanning”
to configure the port range.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.633
Here, we will set the “Port scan range”
to scan all ports.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.500
In this scenario, we have chosen a scan
definition that will scan all TCP ports

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200
via a SYN scan

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.666
but no UDP ports.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.633
While this will increase
the speed of the scan,

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:23.900
we might miss crucial services
running on the target.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:28.566
During an engagement, we must weigh
the stability of the target network,

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.466
the scope of the target,

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.766
the duration of the engagement,

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:36.733
and many other factors when
configuring our port scan options.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.766
We also did not configure any credentials,

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.100
which means that this scan
will run unauthenticated

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.800
and brute forcing of user
credentials will not be enabled,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.000
which is the default for
the Basic Network Scan.

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:52.566
Now that we have reviewed
the configuration options

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.566
and understand what
the scanner is going to do,

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:58.033
we can run our first scan.
