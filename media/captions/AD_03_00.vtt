Active Directory Authentication

00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:08.033
Now that we have enumerated
user accounts, group memberships,

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:14.000
and registered SPN’s, let’s use this
information to compromise Active Directory

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:17.366
In order to do this, we must
first discuss the details

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.833
of Active Directory authentication.

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:25.300
Active Directory supports multiple
authentication protocols and techniques.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.133
However, it uses either Kerberos or
NTLM authentication protocols 

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.600
or most authentication attempts.

00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:37.966
We will discuss the simpler
NTLM protocol first.
