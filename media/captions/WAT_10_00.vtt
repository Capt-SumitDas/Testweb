00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.300
Wrapping Up

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:07.400
In this module, we focused on
the identification and enumeration

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.733
of common web application vulnerabilities.

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:16.466
We also exploited several common
web application vulnerabilities,

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.233
leveraging a variety of
techniques including

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:21.500
admin console weaknesses,

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.433
cross-site scipting,

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.333
directory traversal,

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.133
local and remote file inclusion,

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.233
and SQL injection.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.700
These attack vectors are
the basic building blocks

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.933
we'll use to construct
more advanced attacks.
