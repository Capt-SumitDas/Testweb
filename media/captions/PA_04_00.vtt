Leveraging Password Hashes

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.000
Next, we turn our attention to attacks
focused on the use of password hashes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.262
A cryptographic hash function is one-way 
and implements an algorithm that, 

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:22.700
given an arbitrary block of data, returns 
a fixed-sized bit string 

00:00:22.707 --> 00:00:27.166
called a “hash value” or “message digest”.

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:31.085
One of the most important uses of 
cryptographic hash functions 

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:34.933
is during the password verification 
process.
