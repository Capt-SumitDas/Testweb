Piping

00:00:02.986 --> 00:00:06.086
Continuing with the example using
the wc command,

00:00:06.086 --> 00:00:09.902
let’s have a look at how to redirect the
output from one command

00:00:09.902 --> 00:00:11.884
into the input of another.

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:18.117
We’ll use the pipe character to redirect
the output of the cat command

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.800
to the input of the wc command.

00:00:24.517 --> 00:00:28.351
This concept may seem trivial but piping
together different commands

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.266
is a powerful way to manipulate
all sorts of data.
