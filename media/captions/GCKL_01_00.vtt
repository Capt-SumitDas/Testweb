00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.400
Booting Up Kali Linux

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For best results and consistency with 
the lab guide

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.666
be sure to use the 64-bit 
Kali Linux virtual machine.

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:16.500
Any deviation from this standard build 
could create a work environment

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.100
that is inconsistent with the 
course training material.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.633
On first boot, it’s important to 
change all default passwords

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.300
from a terminal using the 
passwd command.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.433
Let’s do that now.

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:35.600
Throughout the course, we will 
use the kali user account.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.900
It may be tempting to log in as 
the root user,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.066
but this is not recommended.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:44.066
The root user has unrestricted access 
and using it increases 

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.733
the risk of accidentally damaging 
our system.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:52.283
For commands that require 
elevated privileges, we’ll use sudo

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.116
followed by the command we 
wish to run

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.916
and provide our password 
when prompted:
