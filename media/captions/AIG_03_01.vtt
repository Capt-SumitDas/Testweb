00:00:01.391 --> 00:00:04.200
Scanning for the NetBIOS Service

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.900
The NetBIOS service listens
on TCP port 139

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.500
as well as several UDP ports.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.383
It should be noted that SMB,
which listens on TCP port 445,

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:19.700
is a separate protocol from NetBIOS.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.833
NetBIOS is an independent
session layer protocol

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:28.133
and service that allows computers on a
local network to communicate

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:28.933
with each other.

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:34.133
While modern implementations of
SMB can work without NetBIOS,

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:39.366
NetBIOS over TCP is required for
backward compatibility

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.666
and is often enabled together.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.466
For this reason, the enumeration of these
two services often goes hand-in-hand.

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:55.066
We can use nmap to easily
scan for both ports.

00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:04.266
There are other, more specialized tools
for specifically identifying

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:08.233
NetBIOS information, such as nbtscan.

00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:17.933
The -r option is used to specify
local UDP port 137, 

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:21.333
which is used to query the
NetBIOS name service

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.666
for valid NetBIOS names.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.066
nbtscan is very fast and returns
a lot of useful information.
