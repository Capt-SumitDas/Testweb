00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.333
Considerations and Preparations

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:08.033
The methods we discuss in this module 
could endanger the success 

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:11.333
of our engagement and should be used 
with caution 

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.400
and only under specific conditions.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.800
To begin, weâ€™ll present some warnings, 
prepare our Kali machine

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.333
for the exercises and demonstrate and 
overcome some file transfer limitations

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.500
inherant in standard shells.
