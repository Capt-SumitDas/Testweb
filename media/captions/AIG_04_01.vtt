00:00:01.311 --> 00:00:03.733
Scanning for NFS shares

00:00:05.181 --> 00:00:09.833
Both Portmapper and RPCbind
run on TCP port 111.

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:15.466
RPCbind maps RPC services to
the ports on which they listen.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:20.400
RPC processes notify rpcbind
when they start,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.900
registering the ports
they are listening on

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.400
and the RPC program numbers
they expect to serve.

00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:33.900
The client system then contacts
rpcbind on the server

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.100
with a particular RPC program number.

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:42.466
The rpcbind service redirects the
client to the proper port number

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.400
(often TCP port 2049)

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.733
so it can communicate
with the requested service.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.033
We can use nmap to scan for TCP port 111

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.166
and run the rpcinfo NSE script

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.700
on each server

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.533
to find services that may
have registered with rpcbind.

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:09.233
Next weâ€™ll find out how to
make use of this information.
