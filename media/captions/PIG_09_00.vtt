00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.400
SSL Server Test

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.933
Another scanning tool we can use is the
SSL Server Test from Qualys SSL Labs.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:20.833
This tool analyzes a server’s SSL/TLS
configuration

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.600
and compares it against current best
practices.

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:29.266
It will also identify some SSL/TLS related
vulnerabilties,

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.866
such as Poodle or Heartbleed.

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:37.366
Let’s scan www.megacorpone.com and check
the results.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.066
The results are not as bad as the
Security Headers check.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.266
However, the weak Diffie-Hellman key
exchange, RC4 ciphers,

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:02.066
and lack of Forward Secrecy suggest our
target is not applying

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.300
current best practices for SSL/TLS
hardening.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.433
For example, disabling RC4 ciphers

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:15.233
has been recommended for several years
due to mulitple vulnerabilities.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:19.600
We can use these findings to get an
insight on the security practices,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.900
or lack thereof, within the target
organization.
