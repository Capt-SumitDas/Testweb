Wrapping Up

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.466
In this module, we discussed the purpose
of antivirus software

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:12.300
and the most common methods used by
vendors to detect malicious code.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.933
We briefly explained various antivirus
bypass methods

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:22.033
that involve different techniques of
in-memory shellcode injection

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:28.266
and demonstrated successful bypasses
using both Shellter and PowerShell.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:33.133
Although we have successfully bypassed
antivirus detection in both of our

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.366
examples, we have barely scratched the
surface

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:40.433
on the topic of malware detection and
evasion.
