00:00:01.588 --> 00:00:04.588
Remote Desktop Protocol Attack 
with Crowbar

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:09.865
Crowbar is a network authentication 
cracking tool primarily designed 

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:13.566
to leverage SSH keys rather 
than passwords.

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:17.988
It’s also one of the few tools that can 
reliably and efficiently 

00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:19.833
perform password attacks 
 against the RDP service 

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:23.633
on modern versions of Windows.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:27.366
Let’s try this tool against our Windows 
client machine.

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:31.766
First, we need to install Crowbar from
the Kali repository:

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:44.200
Next, we’ll create a small wordlist that 
contains the password 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.866
for our Windows client.

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:55.000
To invoke crowbar, we specify 
the protocol,

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:58.066
the target server,

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.766
a username,

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:03.300
a wordlist,

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:07.033
and the number of threads.

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:15.400
Great, Crowbar discovered working 
credentials for the “admin” user.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.943
Note that we only specified 
a single thread 

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:25.600
since the remote desktop protocol does not
reliably handle multiple threads.
