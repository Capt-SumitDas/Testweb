00:00:01.816 --> 00:00:03.416
Environment Variables

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:08.106
When opening a terminal window, a new 
Bash process, which has its own

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:10.806
environment variables, is initialized.

00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:16.472
These variables are a form of global
storage for various settings inherited by

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:20.206
any applications that are run during
that terminal session.

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.272
One of the most commonly-referenced
environment variables is PATH,

00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:29.006
which is a colon-separated list of
directory paths that Bash will search

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.896
through whenever a command is run 
without a full path.

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:36.452
We can view the contents of a given 
environment variable with the

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:39.842
echo command followed by the 
dollar sign character

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:42.342
and an environment variable name.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:47.309
For example, let’s examine the contents
of the PATH environment variable:

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.562
Some other useful environment
variables include USER…

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:54.606
P.W.D….

00:00:55.206 --> 00:00:56.406
and HOME…

00:00:56.962 --> 00:01:00.696
which hold the values of the current
terminal user’s username,

00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:02.362
present working directory,

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.796
and home directory respectively.

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.339
We can define an environment variable
with the export command.

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:14.272
For example, if we are scanning a target
and don’t want to type in the system’s

00:01:14.272 --> 00:01:19.272
IP address repeatedly, we can quickly
assign it an environment variable

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:21.172
and use that instead:

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.872
The export command makes the variable
accessible to any subprocesses

00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:32.672
we might spawn from our
current Bash instance.

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:37.239
If we set an environment variable 
without export, it will only

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:39.472
be available in the current shell.

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:44.896
Let’s launch another instance of Bash
and try to display the variable again.

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.986
Since we defined our variable without
the export command, 

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:53.052
we can’t access it in
the new Bash instance.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.662
After exiting back to our original
Bash session

00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:00.962
we have access to the variable again.

00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:06.439
Now let’s see what happens when we use
export to define a variable.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:12.339
Nothing has changed so far but
let’s see what happens when we

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:14.706
launch a new Bash instance.

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:21.586
This time, we can access the
variable from the new instance.

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.482
There are many other environment
variables defined by default

00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:29.049
in Kali Linux.

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:33.062
We can view these by running e-n-v
at the command line:

00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:36.406
Take some time to review and experiment

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.339
with the pre-defined environment
variables.
