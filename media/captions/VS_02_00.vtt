Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.633
As we begin looking at tools,

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:10.066
we will first focus on Nessus,

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.333
a popular vulnerability scanner

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:17.333
that supports a staggering 130,000 plugins.

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:21.600
There are many commercial and
open source vulnerability scanners

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.333
with various strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.633
The overall concepts
discussed in this section

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:32.466
will generally apply to just about any
other commercial scanner as well.
