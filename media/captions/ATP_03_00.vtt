Targeting the Database

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.800
As is the case in sandbox.local,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.233
web applications frequently have a
database configured on another server.

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:16.433
But we do have network
access to the database host

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:21.133
and, for the most part, can treat it as
if we are on the same network.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:26.200
However, we may experience
lag because of the tunnels.
