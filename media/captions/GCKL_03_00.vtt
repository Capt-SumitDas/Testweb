00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.400
Kali Documentation

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.433
As a full-blown operating system, Kali 
Linux offers so many features

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:12.970
and capabilities that we can not possibly 
explore them all in this module.

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:17.100
To supplement the information in this 
module, and help “sharpen your axe”

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.866
there are several official Kali Linux 
resources available

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.233
for further research and study.

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:25.900
Let’s take a look at some of them now.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:33.200
This is the official Kali Linux documentation.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.866
This site contains the most current 
Kali documentation, 

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.433
details many common procedures, 

00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:41.900
and should be considered your first stop

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.800
for Kali Linux troubleshooting 
and support.

00:00:46.488 --> 00:00:51.600
The next stop for troubleshooting and 
support is the Kali Linux support forum.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.066
Before posting on this forum, read 
the rules and guidelines.

00:00:56.066 --> 00:01:00.200
Non-compliant posts are often 
moderated or ignored.

00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:04.800
Before creating a new thread, be sure 
to thoroughly search the forums 

00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:07.266
for a previously-posted solution.

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:14.766
As you already know, Kali features many 
penetration testing and forensics tools.

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:20.200
The Kali Tools site lists most of these 
and provides a quick reference for each.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.400
Here, we can track the versions of the 
tools against their upstream sources

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.766
and view information about each of 
the metapackages.

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:32.800
Metapackages provide the flexibility 
to install specific subsets of tools

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.033
based on our particular needs, including 
wireless, web applications, 

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:41.933
forensics, software defined radio, 
and more.

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:49.900
Occasionally, certain tools may crash 
or produce unexpected results.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.166
When this happens, we can search for the 
given error message

00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:56.700
on the Kali Linux Bug Tracker to 
determine whether or not 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.800
the issue is a bug, and if it is, how 
it can be resolved.

00:02:03.704 --> 00:02:08.033
The Kali Linux Training site hosts the 
official Kali Linux Manual 

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:09.633
and training course.

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:12.833
The site hosts the Kali Linux Revealed 
book, exercises designed to test your understanding

00:02:15.783 --> 00:02:19.933
a dedicated support forum, and an 
abundance of useful information

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:23.133
to help better acquaint yourself 
with Kali Linux.
