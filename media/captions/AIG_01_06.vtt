00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.900
Relevant Tools in Kali Linux

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:09.100
There are several tools in Kali Linux that
can automate DNS enumeration.

00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:14.866
Two notable examples are
DNSRecon and DNSenum,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.300
which have useful options that we’ll
explore in the following sections.

00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:22.300
DNSRecon

00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:30.400
DNSRecon is an advanced, modern DNS
enumeration script written in Python.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.300
We can attempt a zone transfer with dnsrecon

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.800
by using the -d option

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.633
to specify a domain name

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:43.400
and -t to specify the type of
enumeration to perform

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.833
(in this case a zone transfer).

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.400
We’ve managed to perform
a successful DNS zone transfer

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.466
against the megacorpone.com domain.

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:06.033
The result is basically a full dump
of the zone file for the domain.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.833
Let’s try to brute force
additional hostnames

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:14.133
with the list we used previously
for forward lookups.

00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:17.700
We’ll use the -D option

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.033
to specify a file name containing
potential subdomain strings,

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:26.366
and -t to specify brute force enumeration.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.866
Our brute force attempt has finished,

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.666
and we have managed
to resolve a few hostnames.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.000
DNSenum

00:01:45.858 --> 00:01:50.133
DNSEnum is another popular
DNS enumeration tool.

00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:52.400
To show a different output,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.033
let’s run dnsenum against
the zonetransfer.me domain,

00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:01.266
which specifically allows zone transfers.

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:05.600
We simply need to pass the domain
of interest to dnsenum.

00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:16.266
These enumeration tools are
both capable and straightforward.

00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:21.000
Take some time to practice with
each before continuing.
