00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.366
Piping and Redirection

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:08.135
Every program run from the command line
has three data streams connected to it

00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:12.015
that serve as communication channels
with the external environment.

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:17.561
These streams are defined as Standard
Input, which is data fed into the program,

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:22.894
Standard Output, which is output from the
program (and defaults to the terminal)

00:00:22.894 --> 00:00:26.261
and Standard Error, which
contains error messages

00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:29.661
and are also displayed by default
in the terminal.

00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:33.794
Piping (using the pipe operator)

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:38.507
and redirection (using the left and
right angle bracket operators,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.720
also known as chevrons or
greater-than and less-than signs)

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.387
connect these streams between programs
and files to accommodate a near

00:00:47.387 --> 00:00:50.620
infinite number of possible use cases.
