00:00:00.862 --> 00:00:03.862
Active Directory Lateral Movement

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:08.066
So far, we located high-value targets

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:11.466
that could lead to a full
Active Directory compromise 

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:17.200
and found the workstations or
servers these targets are logged in to.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:21.800
Next, we will use lateral movement
to compromise the machines

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.700
our high-value targets are logged in to.

00:00:25.534 --> 00:00:29.400
We could attempt to crack any password
hashes we found and authenticate

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.433
to a machine with cleartext passwords
to gain unauthorized access.

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:40.066
However, password cracking
takes time and may fail.

00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:46.500
In addition, Kerberos and NTLM do not use
the cleartext password directly.

00:00:46.902 --> 00:00:48.733
Native tools from Microsoft

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:53.000
also do not support authentication
using the password hash.

00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:57.766
For those reasons, we will look at an
alternative lateral movement technique

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.700
that will allow us to
authenticate to a system

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.233
and gain code execution using only a
userâ€™s hash or a Kerberos ticket.
