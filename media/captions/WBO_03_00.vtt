00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.633
Wrapping Up

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:07.400
In this module we discovered and
exploited a vulnerability

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.833
In the Sync Breeze application.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.700
Even though this was a known
vulnerability,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.500
we walked through the steps 
required to discover it,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.200
and did not rely on previous
vulnerability research.

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:24.300
This essentially replicated the process of
discovering

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.233
and exploiting a remote buffer overflow.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:33.100
This process required several steps.
First, we discovered a vulnerability

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.733
in the code, without access to the source,
and generated application input

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:44.566
that caused an overflow and granted us
control of critical CPU registers.

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:50.333
Next, we manipulated memory to
gain reliable remote code execution.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:55.000
and cleaned up the exploit to avoid
crashing the target application.
