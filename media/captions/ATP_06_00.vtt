Targeting Poultry

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:09.233
Before we continue, a review of what we
know and donâ€™t know would be helpful.

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:17.833
We know that Ajla connects to the internal
network via the database server Zora.

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:22.766
We also just learned that
within the internal network,

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:28.633
a share is mounted to Zora from
another computer named Poultry.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.733
We have a suspicion that Poultry
is running Windows,

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.033
but we are not sure of that yet.

00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:39.700
We also found credentials for a user
within the sandbox domain.

00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:44.633
This means that a domain controller
should exist somewhere.

00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:49.866
Before attempting to use the
discovered credentials,

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:54.900
we will first enumerate Poultry to
discover what our next step should be.
