00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.933
Wrapping Up

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.966
In this module, we covered the process of 
exploiting a buffer overflow

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.600
vulnerability on a Linux operating 
system.

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:15.000
Similar to the exploit used in the
Windows Buffer Overflow module,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.833
we were able to debug a crash in a
vulnerable application

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:21.900
and write a fully working exploit for it.
