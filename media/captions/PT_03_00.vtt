00:00:01.743 --> 00:00:03.677
PowerShell and Powercat

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:10.176
Windows PowerShell is a task-based command
line shell and scripting language.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.777
It’s designed specifically for
the administration

00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:15.877
of multiple operating systems

00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:20.043
and the processes related to the
applications that run on the system.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.593
Needless to say, PowerShell is a
powerful tool for penetration testing

00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:27.793
and can be installed on various
versions of Windows.

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:31.526
PowerShell maintains an execution policy

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:35.493
that determines which type of
PowerShell scripts (if any)

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:37.026
can be run on the system.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.210
The default policy is “Restricted”.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.193
For the purposes of this module, 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.110
we’ll need to set an “Unrestricted”
execution policy on our Windows client.

00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:51.477
To do this, we will need to launch
PowerShell as an Admininstrator

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:56.677
by right-clicking the Start button and
selecting Windows PowerShell Admin.

00:00:59.343 --> 00:01:02.677
When we're presented with the
User Account Control prompt,

00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:04.743
we’ll click Yes to continue.

00:01:05.743 --> 00:01:09.410
Now we’ll set the execution
policy to unrestricted.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.093
Enter y when prompted.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.710
To verify the execution
policy has been updated,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.510
we can run get-executionpolicy.

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:26.144
PowerShell is both responsive
and powerful,

00:01:26.144 --> 00:01:28.944
enabling us to perform multiple tasks

00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:32.144
without installing additional
tools on the target.

00:01:35.177 --> 00:01:38.810
Let’s explore PowerShell a bit more
to demonstrate how it might come into

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.043
play during a penetration test.
