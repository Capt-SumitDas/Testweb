00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:03.000
DNS Enumeration

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.333
DNS is one of the most critical
systems on the Internet.

00:00:06.697 --> 00:00:11.666
It is a distributed database responsible
for translating user-friendly domain names

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.233
 into IP addresses.

00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:15.766
When a browser needs
to resolve a host name,

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.700
like www.megacorpone.com,

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:23.822
it passes the hostname to the
operating systemâ€™s DNS client,

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:27.266
which forwards the request to
the external DNS server

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.866
itâ€™s configured to use.

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:33.666
This first server in the chain
is known as the DNS recursor

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.733
and is responsible for returning
the results to the DNS client.

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.266
The recursor queriesthe
authoritative nameserver,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.866
which contains the DNS records in a
local database known as a zone file.

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:50.000
There are typically
two zones for each domain.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.304
The forward lookup zone is used to find
the IP address of a specific hostname

00:00:55.304 --> 00:00:56.966
and the reverse lookup zone

00:00:56.966 --> 00:01:00.800
is used to find the 
hostname of a specific IP address.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.700
Once the DNS recursor provides
the DNS client with the IP address

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.266
for www.megacorpone.com,

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.500
the browser can contact
the correct web server

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.533
at its IP address and load the webpage.
