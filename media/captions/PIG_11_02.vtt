Password Dumps

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:09.000
Malicious hackers often dump breached
credentials on Pastebin

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.533
or other less reputable websites.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.200
These password dumps can be extremely
valuable for generating wordlists.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:22.266
For example, Kali Linux includes the
“rockyou” wordlist 

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.333
generated from a data breach in 2009.

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:34.233
Checking the email addresses we’ve found
during user enumeration

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.133
against password dumps

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:41.100
can turn up passwords we could use in
credential stuffing attacks.
