Wrapping Up

00:00:03.263 --> 00:00:08.000
In this module, we focused on 
post-exploitation file transfers. 

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:14.733
We learned about traditional file 
transfer methods such as FTP and TFTP

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:18.200
and learned how to upgrade 
non-interactive shells.

00:00:18.694 --> 00:00:24.133
We also focused specifically on Windows-
specific file transfer methods 

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.600
using various scripting languages

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.400
as well as how the exe2hex utility can be used
to transfer files.

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:36.433
We can use these methods in various ways 
during an assessment

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:39.066
to help transfer tools and data

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.166
into or out of a target network.
