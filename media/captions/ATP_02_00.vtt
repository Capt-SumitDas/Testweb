Targeting the Web Application

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.733
First, we will simply browse the
web application home page.

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:22.633
The home page seems to be a fairly
standard company landing page.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.066
The links in the navigation bar

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:29.833
all point to anchors on the home page and
a feedback survey is on the bottom left.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:45.200
There do not appear to be any other
fields with user-controlled input.

00:00:45.574 --> 00:00:50.233
The Nmap scan indicated that the web page
is running on WordPress 5.3,

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:53.500
but we should gather more
information to confirm this.

00:00:54.268 --> 00:00:57.700
While the WordPress core itself
has had its share of vulnerabilities,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.733
the WordPress developers
are quick to patch them.

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:05.000
However, themes and plugins
are written by the community

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.133
and many vulnerabilities
are improperly patched

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.533
or are simply never fixed at all.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.033
This makes WordPress a
great target for compromise.
