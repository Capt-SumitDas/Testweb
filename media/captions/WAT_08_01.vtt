00:00:01.611 --> 00:00:05.166
Identifying File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:10.466
File inclusions can be discovered
in the same way as directory traversals.

00:00:10.893 --> 00:00:13.900
We must locate parameters
we can manipulate

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.666
and attempt to use them
to load arbitrary files.

00:00:18.077 --> 00:00:21.833
However, a file inclusion
takes this one step further,

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:27.333
as we attempt execute the contents
of the file within the application.

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:30.133
We should also check these parameters

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.866
to see if they are vulnerable
to remote inclusion

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:37.633
by changing their values to a
URL instead of a local path.

00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:41.133
We are less likely to
find RFI vulnerabilities

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:45.566
since the default configuration
for modern PHP versions

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.633
disables remote URL includes,

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:52.466
a key feature we need to
execute remote code.

00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:56.300
However, we should still test for RFIs

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.300
as they are often easier
to exploit than LFIs.
