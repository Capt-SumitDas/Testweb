00:00:01.108 --> 00:00:03.841
Introduction to Buffer Overflows

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:08.859
In this module, we’ll present the
principles behind a buffer overflow,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.008
which is a type of memory
corruption vulnerability.

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:17.241
We’ll review how program memory is used,
how a buffer overflow occurs,

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.308
and how the overflow can be used

00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:22.875
to control the execution
flow of an application.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.875
It’s vital that we have a good
understanding of the conditions that make

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:30.875
buffer overflow attacks possible
in order to develop an exploit

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.908
to take advantage of
this type of vulnerability.
