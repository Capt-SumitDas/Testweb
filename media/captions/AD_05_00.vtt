Active Directory Persistence

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.033
Once we have gained access
to the active directory,

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.033
our next goal is to obtain persistence,

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:14.266
ensuring that we do not lose our access
to the compromised machines.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.651
We can use traditional persistence
methods in an AD environment,

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:22.917
but we can also gain AD-specific
persistence as well.

00:00:23.287 --> 00:00:26.733
Note that in many real-world
penetration tests,

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:32.900
persistence is not a part of the scope
due to the risk of incomplete removal.
