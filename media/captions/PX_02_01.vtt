Understanding Windows Privileges
and Integrity Levels

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:10.466
Privileges on Windows operating
systems refer

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:16.133
 to the permissions of a specific account
to perform system-related actions,

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.933
such as modifying the filesystem,

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:23.133
 adding users, shutting down
the system and so on.

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:25.966
For these privileges
to be effective,

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.533
Windows uses objects
called accessÂ tokens.

00:00:30.383 --> 00:00:32.033
Once a user is authenticated,

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:37.300
Windows generates an access token
that is assigned to that user.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.800
The token itself contains various
pieces of information

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.300
that describe the security context of the
user, including the user privileges.

00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:53.866
Tokens need to be uniquely identifiable
depending on the information they contain.

00:00:54.616 --> 00:00:58.400
This is done using a security
identifier or SID,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.500
which is a unique value that is
assigned to each object,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.866
including tokens, user accounts
and group accounts.

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:12.733
In addition to privileges, Windows also
implements an integrity mechanism.

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:17.533
This is a core component of
the Windows security architecture

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:22.833
and works by assigning integrity
levels to application processes

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.200
and securable objects.

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:30.875
In other words, this describes the level
of trust the operating system has

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:37.033
in running applications and dictates what
actions an application can perform,

00:01:37.308 --> 00:01:42.700
including the ability to read from
or write to the local file system.
