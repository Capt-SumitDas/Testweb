Automating Lookups

00:00:03.677 --> 00:00:07.666
Now that we have some initial data
from the megacorpone.com domain,

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.800
we can continue to use
additional DNS queries

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.100
to discover more
hostnames and IP addresses

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.300
belonging to the same domain.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.700
For example,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.098
we know that the domain has a web server,

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:24.700
with the hostname “www.megacorpone.com”.

00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:27.900
Let’s run host against this hostname.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:35.500
Now, let’s see if megacorpone.com

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.133
has a server with
the hostname “idontexist”.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.800
First, we queried a valid hostname and
received an IP resolution response.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.866
By contrast, our second query
returned an NXDOMAIN error,

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:55.733
indicating that a public DNS record
does not exist for that hostname.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.733
Now that we understand
how to search for valid hostnames,

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.700
we can automate our efforts.
