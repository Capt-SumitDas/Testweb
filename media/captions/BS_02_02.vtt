Reading User Input


00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:07.966
Command-line arguments are a form of user 
input, 

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:11.400
but we can also capture interactive user 
input 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.766
while a script is running with the read 
command.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:20.566
In this example, we’ll use read to 
capture user input and assign it 


00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.400
to the answer variable.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.000
Nice. We can now read and process 
information provided by a user.


00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.900
We can alter the behavior of the read 
command with various command line options.


00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:48.966
Two of the most commonly used options 
include -p, which allows us to specify 


00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.100
a prompt…

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:54.800
…and -s, which makes the user input 
silent.


00:00:55.595 --> 00:01:01.033
The -s option is ideal for capturing user 
credentials. Let’s try it out.


00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:14.866
Notice how the -s option hid the password 
as it was entered.
