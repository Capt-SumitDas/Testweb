00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.900
DIRB

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:06.266
DIRB is a web content scanner

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.066
that uses a wordlist to find directories

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.933
and pages by issuing
requests to the server.

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.366
DIRB can identify valid
web pages on a web server

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.566
even if the main index page is missing.

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:24.297
By default, DIRB will identify
interesting directories on the server

00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:28.500
but it can also be customized to
search for specific directories,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.400
use custom dictionaries,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.600
set a custom cookie or header on
each request, and much more.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.766
Letâ€™s run DIRB on www.megacorpone.com.

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:45.333
We will supply several arguments:
the URL to scan,

00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.733
-r to scan non-recursively,

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:56.933
and -z 10 to add a 10 millisecond
delay to each request.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:07.966
According to the output,
DIRB made 4,612 requests

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:14.733
and reported the URL, status code,
and size of nine distinct resources.

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:19.500
By default, the tool will recurse
into newly-discovered directories,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.433
but in this case, our non-recursive scan

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:26.300
simply reports directories
without descending into them.

00:01:26.923 --> 00:01:31.766
Obviously, we could begin with a
non-recursive scan against a large target

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.933
and recursively search
interesting directories,

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:39.433
or begin with a full recursive
scan depending on our needs.
