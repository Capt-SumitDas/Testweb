Google Hacking

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.466
The term “Google Hacking” was popularized
by Johnny Long in 2001.

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.333
Hey, that’s me!

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.966
Through several talks and an extremely
popular book,

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:20.366
he outlined how search engines like Google
could be used to uncover critical

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:25.366
information, vulnerabilities, and
misconfigured websites.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:34.866
At the heart of this technique were clever
search strings and operators that allowed

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.166
creative refinement of search queries,

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.600
most of which work with a variety of
search engines.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.666
The process is iterative, beginning with
a broad search,

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:51.700
which is narrowed down with operators to
sift out irrelevant

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.733
or uninteresting results.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.266
Let’s try a few of these operators and get
a feel for how they work.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.300
The site operator limits searches to a
single domain.

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:06.933
We can use this operator to get a rough
idea of an organization’s web presence.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.100
We can then use further operators to
narrow these results.

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:25.266
For example, the filetype (or ext)
operator

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.966
limits search results to the specified
file type.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.533
In this example, we combine operators to
locate PHP files on


00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:44.766
the megacorpone.com domain.

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:50.400
We only get one result but it is an
interesting one.

00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:54.966
Our query found the login page for an
instance of AlienVault,

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:58.800
a security information and event
management platform.

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:04.200
Usually these tools are only available on
internal networks.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.500
We should note this URL as it might prove
useful if we can find user credentials to

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.100
login during the active exploitation
phase.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:18.600
The ext and filetype operators could also
be helpful to discern what programming

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.966
languages might be used on a web site.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.033
Searching for the jsp, cfm, and pl
extensions will find indexed

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:33.400
Java Server Pages, Adobe Coldfusion, and
Perl pages respectively.

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:39.733
We can also modify an operator using the
minus sign to exclude particular items

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:42.300
from a search, narrowing the results.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:54.933
For example, to find interesting,
non-HTML pages,

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:58.566
we can exclude the HTML filetype from the
results.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.266
In this case, we found several interesting
pages,

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:07.133
including an administrative console.

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:20.566
In another example, we can use a search
for intitle “index of” “parent directory”

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:26.633
to find pages that contain “index of” in
the title and the words “parent directory”

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:28.066
anywhere on the page.

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:34.533
The ouput refers to directory listing
pages

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:39.433
that list the file contents of the
directories without index pages.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:43.333
Misconfigurations like this can reveal
interesting files

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.900
and sensitive information.

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:49.733
These basic examples only scratch the
surface of what we can do

00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:51.100
with search operators.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.066
The Google Hacking Database contains
multitudes of creative searches

00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:09.533
that demonstrate the power of creative
searching with combined operators.

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:14.933
Mastery of these operators, combined with
a keen sense of deduction

00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:19.366
are key skills for effective search engine
“hacking.”
