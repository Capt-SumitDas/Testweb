00:00:01.686 --> 00:00:03.366
Reviewing the Results

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.933
First, let’s concentrate on 10.5.5.30.

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:14.966
At first glance, this appears to be the
domain controller for sandbox.local.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.654
Now that we know what ports are open, we
can conduct a deeper scan on them using

00:00:22.654 --> 00:00:27.100
the default Nmap scripts in an attempt to
extract some more information.

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:35.798
The domain controller seems to
be a newer build of Windows,

00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:41.000
and from both scans, it does not seem
to be running any services

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.366
other than those intended
for a domain controller.

00:00:45.157 --> 00:00:49.200
While it’s possible for a domain
controller to be directly exploitable

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.266
through specific vulnerabilities, from
our experience, this is unlikely

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:57.333
since these servers are
typically hardened.

00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:06.233
Let’s move on to reviewing 10.5.5.25 in
hopes that it will be a better target.

00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:12.633
We will start by again conducting an
Nmap scan using the default Nmap scripts.

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.041
The Nmap scan discovered that
the target is named Cevapi,

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:22.900
and is running Windows 10 Pro.

00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:28.500
Our Nmap scan also discovered
port 8080 open on the host

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.533
and suggested that an
http-proxy service is running on it.

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:39.766
However, this port is also commonly
used to run HTTP applications.

00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:44.966
One simple way of gathering more
information is to visit the page.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:51.800
We first have to configure Firefox
to use our SOCKS proxy.

00:01:56.726 --> 00:02:00.600
This can be done by adding a
new configuration to Foxy Proxy.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.366
We’ll enter ProxyChains for the name,

00:02:06.917 --> 00:02:09.566
set the Proxy Type to SOCKS4,

00:02:13.702 --> 00:02:18.333
then enter the localhost IP
with the port of 1080.

00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:24.078
Finally, we click Save and
select ProxyChains

00:02:24.078 --> 00:02:27.045
by clicking on the Foxy Proxy icon.

00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:38.266
Next, we’ll navigate to
Cevapi on port 8080.

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:47.400
The page that opens up
is a Jenkins login page.

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:52.966
This is a very interesting target
as Jenkins is an extremely powerful

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:57.266
piece of software that might
expose an attack surface.

00:02:57.722 --> 00:03:01.266
We’ll concentrate our efforts
on this host next.
