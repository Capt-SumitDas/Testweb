00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.133
Replicating the Crash

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.400
Based on our fuzzer output, we can assume
that SyncBreeze is vulnerable

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.966
to a buffer overflow when a username
having a length of about 800 bytes

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.133
is submitted during login.

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:22.000
Our first task in the exploitation process
is to write a simple script 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.533
that will replicate our observed crash,


00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.700
without having to run the fuzzer
each time.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:38.300
Our new script declares an inputBuffer
of 800 Aâ€™s,

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:44.066
and provides that string as the
username in the POST reqeust.

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:49.033
When executed, this script should
cause an access violation 

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:51.466
similar to what we observed earlier.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.533
We are able to consistently
replicate the crash.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.966
This is a good first step.
