00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:02.000
Wrapping Up

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.200
In this module, we have covered
the concept of privilege escalation

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.600
on both Windows and
Linux operating systems.

00:00:11.108 --> 00:00:15.533
We covered both manual and
automated enumeration techniques

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:20.133
to find important information
for common escalation vectors.

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:24.966
We also demonstrated how to compile
code on both windows and Linux,

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:31.000
as well as several privilege escalation
attacks and various privilege escalations

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.333
 based on misconfigurations
instead of vulnerable software.
