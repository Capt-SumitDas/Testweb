00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.966
Windows Buffer Overflows

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:08.666
In this module, we will demonstrate how to
discover and exploit a vulnerability 

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.533
in the SyncBreeze application.

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.333
Although we are examining a known
vulnerability, 

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.566
we will walk through the steps required to
“discover it” 

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:21.466
and will not rely on previous research
for this application.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:26.533
This will essentially replicate the
process of discovering and exploiting

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.333
a remote buffer overflow.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.033
This process requires several steps.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:37.966
First, we must discover a vulnerability in
the code without access to the source.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.933
Then, we have to craft our input in
such a way 

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:46.100
that grants us control of critical
CPU registers.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.933
Finally, we need to manipulate memory to
gain reliable remote code execution.
