Inspecting URLs

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.300
File extensions,
which are sometimes a part of a URL,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.300
can reveal the programming language
the application was written in.

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.533
Some of these, like .php,

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:15.900
are straightforward,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.100
but other extensions are more cryptic and
vary based on the frameworks in use.

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:29.666
For example, a Java-based web application
might use .jsp, .do, or .html.

00:00:30.184 --> 00:00:34.300
However, file extensions on web
pages are becoming less common

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.866
since many languages and frameworks
now support the concept of routes,

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:44.100
which allow developers to
map a URI to a section of code.

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.233
Applications leveraging routes use logic

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.633
to determine what content
is returned to the user

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:54.600
and make URI extensions
largely irrelevant.
