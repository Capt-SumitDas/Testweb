00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.166
SSH Tunneling

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:09.266
The SSH protocol is one of the most
popular protocols for tunneling

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.866
and port forwarding.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:16.633
This is due to its ability to create
encrypted tunnels within the SSH protocol.

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:23.100
This obscure feature of the SSH protocol
has far-reaching implications for

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.433
penetration testers and system
administrators alike.
