Wrapping Up

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.900
Vulnerability scanning can be very helpful

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.033
during the initial phase
of a penetration test.

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:10.733
Once configured correctly,

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:14.833
vulnerability scanning tools
can provide a wealth of information

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:18.533
and reveal some serious
and unforeseen vulnerabilities

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:23.500
that can have a significant impact
during a penetration testing engagement.

00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:25.200
That being said,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.600
it is important to understand that
a manual review is still required

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.033
and that scanners can
only discover vulnerabilities

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.766
that they are programmed for.
