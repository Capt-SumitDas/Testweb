Security Headers Scanner

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:09.466
There are several other specialty websites
that we can use to gather information

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:13.433
about a website or domain’s security
posture.

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:19.133
Some of these sites blur the line between
passive and active information gathering,

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.633
but the key point for our purposes

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:25.766
is that a third-party is initiating any
scans or checks.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:35.566
One such site, Security Headers, will
analyze HTTP response headers

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:40.366
and provide basic analysis of the target
site’s security posture.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.466
We can use this to get an idea of an
organization’s coding and security

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.833
practices based on the results.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:54.366
Let’s scan www.megacorpone.com and check
the results.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.633
The site is missing several defensive
headers,

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:03.733
such as Content-Security-Policy and
X-Frame-Options.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.266
These missing headers are not necessarily
vulnerabilities in and of themselves,

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:13.500
but could indicate that the target
environment has not been hardened.
