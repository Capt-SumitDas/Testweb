00:00:01.452 --> 00:00:03.819
Transferring Files with Netcat

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.544
Netcat can also be used to transfer files,
both text and binary,

00:00:09.565 --> 00:00:11.631
from one computer to another.

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:15.289
To send a file from our Kali machine
to the Windows system,

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.189
we’ll use another client-server setup
similar to the previous chat example,

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.956
with some minor differences.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:27.623
On the Windows machine, we’ll run
a Netcat listener on port 4444

00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:33.489
and redirect any output into a
file called incoming.exe

00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:40.440
On our Kali system, we’ll push the
wget.exe file to the Windows machine

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.907
through TCP port 4444.

00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:51.174
Notice that we are redirecting
wget.exe into the Netcat connection.

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:56.898
After hitting enter, the connection is
received by Netcat on the Windows machine.

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:00.831
Notice that we have not
received any feedback from

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.865
Netcat about our file upload progress.

00:01:04.044 --> 00:01:07.810
This is completely normal and
means we need to make a best guess

00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:10.798
and give the file enough
time to be transferred.

00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:14.331
In this case, since the file we're
uploading is small,

00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:16.331
we can just wait a few seconds,

00:01:16.374 --> 00:01:20.707
then check whether the file has been
fully uploaded to the Windows machine

00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:22.240
by attempting to run it.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:30.719
We can see that this is, in fact,
the wget.exe executable

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.019
which means the file
transfer was successful.
