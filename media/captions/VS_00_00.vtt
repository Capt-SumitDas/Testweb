Vulnerability Scanning

00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:09.766
Vulnerability discovery is an integral
part of any security assessment.

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:12.833
While we prefer manual, specialized tasks

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:16.533
that leverage our knowledge and experience
during a security audit,

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:22.166
automated vulnerability scanners can be
invaluable when used in proper context.

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:27.133
In this module, weâ€™ll provide an overview
of automated vulnerability scanning,

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:29.666
discuss its various considerations,

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:35.000
and focus on both Nessus and Nmap
as indispensable tools.
