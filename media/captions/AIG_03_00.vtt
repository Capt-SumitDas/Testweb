SMB Enumeration

00:00:04.747 --> 00:00:07.733
The security track record
of the SMB protocol

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:11.200
has been poor for many years
due to its complex implementation

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.800
and open nature.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:18.666
From unauthenticated SMB null
sessions in Windows 2000 and XP,

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:22.903
to a plethora of SMB bugs and
vulnerabilities over the years,

00:00:22.903 --> 00:00:25.900
SMB has seen its fair share of action.
