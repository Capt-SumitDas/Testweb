00:00:01.707 --> 00:00:02.607
grep

00:00:03.776 --> 00:00:04.676
In a nutshell,

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.592
grep searches text files for the
occurrence of a given regular expression

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:12.458
and outputs any line containing a match

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:13.858
to standard output,

00:00:13.858 --> 00:00:15.858
which is usually the terminal screen.

00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:18.241
Consider the following example:

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:24.754
We listed all the files in the /usr/bin
directory with ls,

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:27.754
and piped the output into the 
grep command,

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:31.721
which searches for any line containing
the string “zip”.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:36.392
Some of the most commonly used switches
include -r for recursive searching

00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:39.474
and -i to ignore the case of the text.

00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:44.058
Refer to the grep man page for more
information about various options.

00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:49.125
Understanding the grep tool and when to
use it can prove incredibly useful.
