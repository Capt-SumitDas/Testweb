Active Directory Attacks

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:07.500
Active Directory is a service that allows
system administrators to manage

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.133
operating systems, applications,
users, and data access on a large scale.

00:00:13.577 --> 00:00:15.966
Since Active Directory
can be highly complex,

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:19.700
it poses a very large attack
surface and warrants attention.

00:00:20.268 --> 00:00:24.600
In this module, we will introduce Active
Directory and demonstrate enumeration,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.533
authentication and lateral
movement techniques.
