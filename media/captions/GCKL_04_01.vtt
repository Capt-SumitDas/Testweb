00:00:01.035 --> 00:00:03.400
The Linux Filesystem

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.733
Kali Linux adheres to the filesystem 
hierarchy standard, 

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:12.200
which provides a familiar and 
universal layout for all Linux users.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.766
The directories you will find most 
useful are: /bin

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:21.511
which contains basic programs like 
ls, cd, and cat.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:31.566
/sbin which contains system 
programs such as fdisk, mkfs, and sysctl

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:37.266
/etc which contains 
configuration files

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:45.466
/tmp which contains temporary files 
that are typically deleted on boot

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.806
/user/bin which contains 
applications like apt, ncat, and nmap

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.800
and /user-slash-share

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.833
which contains application support 
and data files

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:06.666
There are many other somewhat more 
obscure directories, 

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.016
which youâ€™ll rarely need to explore,

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:12.500
but make sure you understand these 
basics before continuing.
