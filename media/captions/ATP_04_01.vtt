00:00:01.357 --> 00:00:04.766
More Thorough Post Exploitation

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:10.866
Previously, we learned that Ajla is
running on Ubuntu 16.04,

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.233
which is a fairly recent version.

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:19.566
We may not be able to find
a kernel exploit for this version.

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:23.633
However, we shouldn’t totally
rule out the possibility.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.566
After enumerating running processes,

00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:30.233
system services,

00:00:32.923 --> 00:00:34.833
and installed applications,

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:40.200
we find that other than
the WordPress install,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.033
the Ubuntu server is only running
default services and applications.

00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:47.366
This does not look promising.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.766
To complete the applications
and services assessment

00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:55.766
we’ll run netstat to determine
what other ports might be open.

00:00:58.554 --> 00:01:03.033
Unfortunately, the output doesn’t
reveal anything interesting either.

00:01:03.154 --> 00:01:08.000
At this point, our best option is to
start looking at kernel exploits.

00:01:08.436 --> 00:01:12.466
But first we need to find out which
kernel version our target is running.

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:18.033
Now that we have the kernel
version, we will return to searchsploit.

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:31.700
While many of these seem like they might
work one in particular grabs our attention

00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:42.166
After reviewing the source
code for exploit 45010,

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:48.000
we see that it is well written, was tested
against several different kernel versions,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.133
and has great instructions
on compiling and executing.

00:01:59.677 --> 00:02:03.900
First, let’s find out if Ajla has gcc.

00:02:13.207 --> 00:02:18.066
Unfortunately, Ajla does not have
the gcc binary installed

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:21.766
 so we will need to compile the
exploit on our Kali machine,

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:25.533
transfer it to Ajla, and hope
that it will still work.
