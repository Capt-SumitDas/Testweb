Win32 Buffer Overflow Exploitation

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.333
Discovering an exploitable vulnerability
is exciting, 

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.800
but developing that discovery into a
working exploit 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.966
and successfully getting a shell is even
more exciting and practical.

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:25.733
To that end, our first goal is to gain
control of the EIP register.
