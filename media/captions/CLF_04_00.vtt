00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.400
Editing Files from the Command Line

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.133
Next, letâ€™s take a look at file editing 
in a command shell environment.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.000
This is an extremely important
Linux  skill, 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.366
especially if you happen to get access to
a Unix-like OS during a penetration test.

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:20.033
Although there are text editors like
gedit and leafpad 

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:24.100
that might be more visually appealing due
to their graphical user interface, 

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.533
we will focus on text-based
terminal editors, 

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.966
which emphasize both
speed and versatility.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.500
Everyone seems to have a preference when
it comes to text editors, 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.000
but we will cover basic usage for the two
most common options: 

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.933
nano and vi.
