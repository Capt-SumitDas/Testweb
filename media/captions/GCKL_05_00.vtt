Managing Kali Linux Services

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.866
Kali Linux is a specialized Linux 
distribution aimed at 

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:13.466
security professionals and contains 
several non-standard features.

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:18.066
The default Kali installation ships 
with several services preinstalled,

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:22.666
such as SSH, HTTP, and MySQL.

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:26.500
To maintain a low profile, Kali 
prevents network services 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.967
from starting by default unless 
we explicitly enable them.
