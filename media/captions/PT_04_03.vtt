Capture Filters

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:07.632
When Wireshark loads, we’re
presented with a basic window

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:10.565
where we can select the network
interface we want to monitor

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:14.298
as well as set display
and capture filters.

00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:18.851
We can use capture filters to reduce
the amount of captured traffic

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:22.751
and narrow our focus to the
packets we wish to analyze.

00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:27.018
We’ll start by selecting the
interface we’d like to monitor

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:30.484
and we’ll enter a capture
filter for our lab subnet.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:36.065
In this case, we use the net filter
to only capture traffic

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.465
within a specified address range.

00:00:38.998 --> 00:00:40.732
With the capture filter set,

00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:46.765
we can start the capture by double-clicking
our VPN network interface, tap0,

00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:49.365
from the list of available interfaces.
