00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:04.858
Getting Familiar with MSF Syntax

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.783
The Metasploit Framework includes several
thousand modules, divided into categories.

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.833
The categories are displayed
on the splash screen summary

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:19.600
but we can also view
them with show -h.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.233
To activate a module, enter “use”
followed by the module name.

00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:42.183
This will activate the module and change
the prompt to indicate the active module.

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.800
We can use “back” to move
out of the current context

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.000
and return to the main prompt:

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:58.091
A variation of “back” is “previous”,
which will switch us to the

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:02.258
previously selected module
instead of the main prompt: 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.283
Most modules require options
before they can be run.

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:14.208
We can view these options
with “show options”.

00:01:15.983 --> 00:01:19.683
We can configure these options
with “set” and “unset”

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.350
The only option that does not have
a value set by default is RHOSTS,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.591
which is the remote host
IP address of the target.

00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:37.550
To perform a scan of our Windows
workstation with the tcp portscan module,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.058
we must first set
the RHOSTS option

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:44.450
with the remote host IP address
using the set command.

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:48.575
With the module
configured, we can run it.

00:01:55.283 --> 00:02:00.183
The TCP scanner module found a
number of listening ports on our target.
