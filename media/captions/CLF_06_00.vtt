Managing Processes

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:08.704
The Linux kernel manages multitasking
through the use of processes.

00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:11.683
The kernel maintains information
about each process

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:13.693
to help keep things organized,

00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:18.304
and each process is assigned a
number called a process ID.

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:23.727
The Linux shell also introduces
the concept of jobs

00:00:23.727 --> 00:00:26.493
to ease our workflow
during a terminal session.

00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:30.624
For example, this is a pipeline
of two processes,

00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:33.424
which the shell considers a single job.

00:00:34.393 --> 00:00:38.893
Job control refers to the ability to
selectively suspend the execution

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:42.737
of jobs, and resume their execution
at a later time.

00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:46.627
We can achieve this with the
help of specific commands,

00:00:46.627 --> 00:00:48.260
which weâ€™ll soon explore.
