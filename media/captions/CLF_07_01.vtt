tail

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:08.465
The most common use of tail is to monitor
log file entries as they are being written

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:13.411
For example, we may want to
monitor the Apache logs,

00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:17.011
to see if a web server is being
contacted by a given client

00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:20.844
we are attempting to attack
with a client-side exploit.

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.265
The -f option is very useful.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:27.432
It continuously updates the output
as the target file grows.

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:30.690
Since our local Apache web server
is already running,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.657
we’ll visit the default
page using Firefox.

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:43.599
If we go back to our terminal, we should
see the requests made in the log file.

00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:53.278
Another convenient switch is -nX

00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:59.244
which outputs the last “X” number of lines,
instead of the default value of 10.

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:03.965
Tail has a number of other useful
options outlined in its man page.
