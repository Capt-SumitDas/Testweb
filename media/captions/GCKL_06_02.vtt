00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:04.200
apt upgrade

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.900
After updating the APT database, we can 
upgrade the installed packages 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.000
and core system to the latest versions 
using the apt upgrade command.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.466
In order to upgrade a single package, 

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:23.166
supply the package name as an option 
to the apt upgrade command.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.133
While you can fully upgrade your 
Kali Linux installation at any time, 

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:33.360
itâ€™s a good idea to take a snapshot of 
the virtual machine in a clean state 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.900
before doing so.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.766
This gives you the ability to roll back 
the VM 

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.966
if the upgrade causes unexpected results.
