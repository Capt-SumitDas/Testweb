00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:04.066
Port Redirection and Tunneling


00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.866
In this module, we will examine different
forms of port redirection,

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.933
tunneling, and traffic encapsulation.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.066
Tunneling a protocol involves
encapsulating it within

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.666
a different protocol.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.666
By using various tunneling techniques,

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:26.733
we can carry a specific protocol over an
incompatible delivery network,

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:31.533
or provide a secure route through an
untrusted network.

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.300
Understanding these techniques will
provide us with the skills needed to

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.566
control the directional flow of traffic,
which can often be useful in

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.400
limited network environments.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:47.133
These concepts can be challenging to
understand and difficult to visualize,

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.733
but we will work through several
hypothetical scenarios to gain a clearer

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.133
picture of the process.
