00:00:01.223 --> 00:00:03.556
Following TCP Streams

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:06.700
Wireshark allows us to
view network traffic

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.067
including the contents
of each packet.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.767
However, we’re often more interested
in streams of data

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:14.796
between various applications.

00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:19.330
We can make use of Wireshark’s
ability to reassemble a specific session

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.030
and display it in various formats.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.096
To view a particular TCP stream, we
can right-click a packet of interest,

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:31.330
such as the one containing the
USER command in our FTP session…

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:35.126
…then select Follow >

00:00:36.163 --> 00:00:37.430
TCP Stream.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:43.100
The reassembled TCP stream
is much easier to read,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.300
and we can review our
interaction with the FTP server.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.903
Because FTP is a clear-text protocol,

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:55.100
we can see the commands and output
sent and received by our FTP client.

00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:02.960
We can clear the filter clicking the ‘x’
to the right of the display filter.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.230
Note that this does not
restart the capture.
