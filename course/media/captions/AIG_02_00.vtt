Port Scanning

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:05.900
Port scanning is the process of inspecting

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.066
TCP or UDP ports on a remote machine

00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:13.433
with the intention of detecting what
services are running on the target,

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:17.233
and what potential attack
vectors may exist.

00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:20.233
Using a proper port scanning methodology

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:23.966
can significantly improve our
efficiency as penetration testers

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.700
while also limiting many of the risks.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.166
Depending on the scope of the engagement,

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:32.633
instead of running a full port scan
against the target network,

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:37.166
we can start by only scanning
for ports 80 and 443.

00:00:37.657 --> 00:00:40.066
With a list of possible web servers,

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.666
we can run a full port scan against
these servers in the background

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.866
while performing other enumeration.

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:48.500
Once the full port scan is complete,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.666
we can further narrow our scans

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:55.000
to probe for more and more information
with each subsequent scan.

00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:59.933
The results of one scan determine the
type and scope of the next scan.
