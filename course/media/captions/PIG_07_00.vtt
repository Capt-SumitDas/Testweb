00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:02.266
Shodan

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.833
As we gather information on our target,
it is important to remember that

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:11.733
traditional websites are just one part of
the Internet.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:23.133
Shodan is a search engine that crawls
devices connected to the Internet

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.100
including, but not limited to the World
Wide Web.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.433
This includes the servers that run
websites

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:34.500
but also devices like routers and IoT
devices.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:39.500
To put it another way, Google and other
search engines look for web server

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.966
content, while Shodan searches for
Internet-connected devices,

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:49.000
interacts with them, and displays
information about them.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:53.833
Although Shodan is not required to
complete any material in this module

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:56.766
or the labs, it’s worth exploring a bit.

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:04.666
Let’s start by using Shodan to search for
hostname:megacorpone.com

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:17.500
In this case, Shodan lists the IPs,
services, and banner information.

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:23.100
All this is gathered passively without
interacting with the client’s web site.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.133
This information gives us a snapshot of
our target’s Internet footprint.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.800
For example, there are eight servers
running SSH,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.866
and we can drill down on this to refine
our results by clicking on

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:41.300
SSH under Top Services.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.666
Based on Shodan’s results, we know
exactly which version of OpenSSH

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.433
is running on each server.

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:54.966
If we click on an IP address, we can
retrieve a summary of the host.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.833
We can view the ports, services,

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:04.200
and technologies used by the server on
this page.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.300
Shodan will also reveal if there are any
published vulnerabilities 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.133
for any of the identified services or
technologies.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.400
This information is invaluable when
determining where to start

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.700
when we move to active testing.
