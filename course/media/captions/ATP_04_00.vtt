00:00:01.363 --> 00:00:05.166
Deeper Enumeration of the
Web Application Server

00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:09.933
During this round of enumeration, our goal
is to find something that will give us

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:14.466
a higher level of access to
Zora’s MariaDB service.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.900
While we could continue trying to
enumerate Ajla with our current user,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.000
www-data, we’ll instead try
to escallate our privileges.

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:28.533
We’ll first concentrate our enumeration
efforts on privilege escalation,

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.233
then move on to looking for credentials.

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:33.900
To look for a privilege escalation vector,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.366
we will need to go back to
our Meterpreter shell on Ajla.
