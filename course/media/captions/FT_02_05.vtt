Uploading Files with TFTP

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:09.700
During a Penetration Test, we can use
TFTP to transfer files

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.300
from older Windows Operatinng Systems

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.466
up to Windows XP and 2003.

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:19.733
This is a terrific tool for 
non-interactive file transfer

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:23.900
But it's not installed by default on 
systems running Windows 7

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.166
Windows 2008 and newer.

00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:31.633
For these reasons, TFTP is not an ideal 
file transfer protocol 

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:33.233
for most situations.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:37.166
but under the right circumstances, it has
its advantages. 

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.566
Before we learn how to transfer files 
with TFTP, 

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:46.433
we first need to install and configure 
a TFTP server in Kali.

00:00:54.658 --> 00:01:00.000
We also need to create a directory to 
serve files and configure its permissions.

00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:15.200
Now we will run atftpd, the TFTP server, 
as a daemon on UDP port 69…

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:20.633
…and direct it to serve files from 
the /tftp directory.

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:31.000
As we did before, we'll reuse one of the 
binaries we previously uploaded

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.366
to the victim machine to simulate data
exfiltration

00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:42.083
We’ll run the tftp client with -i to 
specify a binary image transfer

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:45.866
followed by the IP address of 
our Kali system.

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:50.566
Then, we provide the put command to 
request an upload, 

00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:53.900
and pass the filename of the file 
to transfer.

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:06.766
Great, we now have yet another technique 
to transfer files to a compromised system.
