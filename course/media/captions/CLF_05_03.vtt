00:00:01.706 --> 00:00:03.339
vimdiff

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:07.915
vimdiff opens vim
(an extended version of vi)

00:00:07.927 --> 00:00:11.427
with multiple files, one in
each window.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.039
the differences between files
are highlighted,

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.706
which makes it easier to visually
inspect them.

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:19.218
There are a few shortcuts
that may be useful.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.630
For example, pressing control-w
followed by an arrow key

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.263
allows us to switch between windows.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.460
Pressing the right-bracket
and the letter c

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.327
will jump to the next change in the diff.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.172
And the left-bracket followed
by the letter c

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.672
will jump to the previous change

00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:40.894
The d-o key combination

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:45.194
will get a change from the other
window and put it in the current one.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.303
The d-p combination will put the
change from the current window

00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:53.703
into the other one.

00:00:54.127 --> 00:00:58.027
To quit vimdiff,
use the same shortcuts as vi.
