The term post-exploitation refers to the 
actions performed by an attacker

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.333
once they have gained some level 
of control of a target.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.433
These actions include elevating 
privileges, expanding control 

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:19.100
into additional machines, installing 
backdoors, 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.400
cleaning up evidence of the attack, 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.133
uploading files and tools to the target, 
etcetera.
