00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.766
Password Attacks

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.600
Passwords are the most basic form of 
user account and service authentication.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.466
By extension, the goal of a password 
attack is to discover

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:19.933
and use valid credentials in order to 
gain access to a user account or service.

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:24.666
In general terms, there are a few common 
approaches to password attacks.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:29.233
We can either make attempts at guessing 
a password through a dictionary attack 

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.800
using various wordlists or we can brute 
force 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.200
every possible character in a password.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.000
In general, a dictionary attack 
prioritizes speed, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.300
offering less password coverage, 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.900
while brute force prioritizes password 
coverage at the expense of speed.

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.966
Both techniques can be used 
effectively during an engagement, 

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:55.566
depending on our priorities and 
time requirements.

00:00:55.566 --> 00:01:00.500
In some cases, once we gain (usually 
privileged) access to a target

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.066
and we’re able to extract password 
hashes,

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:08.366
we can leverage password cracking attacks 
that seek to gain access 

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:13.100
to the cleartext password, or 
Pass-the-Hash attacks, 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.766
which allow us to authenticate to a 
Windows-based target 

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.733
using only a username and the hash.

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:23.166
In this module, we’ll discuss each of 
these concepts 

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.700
and techniques in more detail

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.666
and demonstrate how they can be 
leveraged in various attack scenarios.
