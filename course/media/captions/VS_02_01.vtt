00:00:01.257 --> 00:00:03.033
Installing Nessus

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.633
It is important to mention that
vulnerability scanners

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:09.600
are generally resource-intensive.

00:00:10.187 --> 00:00:13.900
Many of them suggest minimum requirements
that include at least

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.033
2 CPU cores as well as 8GB of RAM.

00:00:20.337 --> 00:00:24.133
These resource requirements won’t be
necessary for our example.

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.300
Although Nessus is not available
in the Kali repositories,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.466
we can manually download
the 64-bit deb file for Kali

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.300
from the Tenable website.

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:58.433
Once our download has completed,
we can install the package with apt.

00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:14.300
Once the package is installed,
we can start the nessusd service,

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:26.266
then return to our browser and
navigate to port 8834 on localhost.

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.766
The default Nessus server port.

00:01:29.497 --> 00:01:34.500
We are presented with a certificate error
indicating an unknown certificate issuer,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.666
but this is expected due to the
use of a self-signed certificate.

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:42.900
To accept the self-signed certificate,
we click on Advanced,

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:45.166
and “Add Exception”.

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:49.778
Finally, we can click
“Confirm Security Exception”

00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:51.500
to accept the certificate.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.033
Once the page loads, we are prompted
to select a Nessus product.

00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:02.233
In this scenario, we are going
to configure Nessus Essentials.

00:02:04.216 --> 00:02:09.266
Next, we are prompted to request
an activation code for Nessus Essentials.

00:02:09.687 --> 00:02:13.233
Since we have already requested a code,
we can skip this step.

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:18.566
On this page, we’ll paste in 
ur activation code to continue.

00:02:20.438 --> 00:02:25.366
After activating Nessus, we are prompted
to create a local Nessus user account.

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:36.233
Finally, we need to download
and compile all the plugins.

00:02:36.654 --> 00:02:39.333
This can take a significant
amount of time to complete.
