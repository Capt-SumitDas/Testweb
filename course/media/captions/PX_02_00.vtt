00:00:01.857 --> 00:00:05.166
Windows Privilege Escalation Examples

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:09.100
In this section, we will look
at Windows privileges,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.266
integrity mechanisms and
user audit control (UAC).

00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:20.900
We will demonstrate UAC bypass techniques
and leverage kernel driver vulnerabilities,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.333
insecure file permissions,

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:29.266
and unquoted service paths to
escalate our privileges on Windows.
