Netcraft

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:07.566
Netcraft is an Internet services company
based in England

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.933
offering a free web portal

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:13.400
that performs various information gathering
functions.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:26.266
The use of services such as those offered
by Netcraft is considered a passive

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:30.133
technique since we never interact with our
target directly.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.033
Let’s review some of Netcraft’s
capabilities.

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.966
For example, we can use Netcraft’s DNS
search page,

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:49.266
to gather information about the
megacorpone.com domain.

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:59.666
For each server found, we can view a
“site report”.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:11.266
These reports provide additional
information and history about the server.

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:15.000
The beginning of the report covers
registration information.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:20.633
However, if we scoll down, we discover
various “site technology” entries.


00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:27.866
This list of subdomains and technologies

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:33.233
will prove useful as we move on to active
information gathering and exploitation.
