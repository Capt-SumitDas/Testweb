Exploiting Local File Inclusion

00:00:05.898 --> 00:00:10.166
Let’s return to the sample application
on our Windows 10 lab machine.

00:00:10.763 --> 00:00:14.466
We will pick up where we left off
with the directory traversal attack

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:18.566
and take a look at the
source code of menu.php

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.266
to clarify what we are dealing with.

00:00:23.513 --> 00:00:29.033
The application reads in the file
parameter from the request query string,

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:34.433
and then uses that value
with an include statement.

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:36.500
This means that the application

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.133
will execute any PHP code
within the specified file.

00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:46.166
We might be able to push this
vulnerability to remote code execution

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:50.833
if we can somehow write
PHP code to a local file.

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:57.666
Since we can’t upload a file to the server,
what options do we have?
