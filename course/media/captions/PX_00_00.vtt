00:00:01.176 --> 00:00:02.700
Privilege Escalation

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.700
During a penetration test, we often
gain an initial foothold on a system

00:00:08.703 --> 00:00:12.033
as a standard or non-privileged user.

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:15.751
In these cases, our next step is
to gain additional access

00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:19.317
rights to demonstrate the full
impact of the compromise.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.800
This process is referred to as
Privilege escalation

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.833
and it is a necessary
skill as “direct-to-root”

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:30.133
compromises are rare in
modern environments.

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:35.200
While every target can be considered
unique due to differences in OS versions,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.066
patching levels, and
various other factors,

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:41.466
there are some common
escalation approaches.

00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:45.866
To take advantage of these, we will
search for misconfigured services,

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:50.000
 insufficient file permissions,
kernel vulnerabilities,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.700
and vulnerable software running
with high privileges, to name a few.
