00:00:01.412 --> 00:00:03.566
Public Network Enumeration

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.666
We’ll begin by conducting
a scan of the external host

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.600
resolvable through the
DNS name sandbox.local.

00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:16.600
We’ll use Nmap’s default set of scripts,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.466
use a SYN scan for faster run time,

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:21.533
scan all ports,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.433
and only target the sandbox.local network.

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:31.500
Let’s review the results of this scan.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:36.200
First, the Nmap scan revealed
only two open ports:

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:38.066
22 and 80.

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:45.333
Nmap fingerprinted the services
as SSH and HTTP respectively.

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:51.066
The Nmap default set of plugins
also revealed the ssh-hostkeys.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.233
The HTTP service is showing us that

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:59.900
the running application
might be WordPress 5.3.

00:01:01.212 --> 00:01:04.966
HTTP is a higher-risk service than SSH.

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:09.066
Because of this,
we will focus on the HTTP service

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:13.266
as we attempt to compromise
the sandbox.local environment.
