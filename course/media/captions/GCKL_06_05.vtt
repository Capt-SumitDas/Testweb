00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:06.133
apt remove -purge

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:12.266
The apt remove –purge command completely 
removes packages from Kali.

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:16.000
It’s important to note that removing a 
package with “apt remove” 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.933
removes all package data, but leaves 
user configuration files behind.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.600
Adding the purge option removes all 
the leftovers,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.566
 including configuration files.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:38.366
Good! You are now able to search, install, 
and remove tools in Kali Linux with apt.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.900
Let’s explore one last command in this 
module.
