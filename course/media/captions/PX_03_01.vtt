Understanding Linux Privileges

00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:09.600
Let’s first take a moment to
briefly discuss Linux privileges,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.333
access controls, and users.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:17.966
One of the defining features of Linux is
that most resources, including files,

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:22.300
directories, devices, and even
network communications

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.966
are represented as
files in the filesystem.

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:28.833
In other words, “everything is a file”.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:35.933
Every file has 3 basic permissions:
read, write, and execute.
