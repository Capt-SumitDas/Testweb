00:00:01.478 --> 00:00:02.245
Alias

00:00:03.085 --> 00:00:07.118
An alias is a string we can define
that replaces a command name.

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:11.785
Aliases are useful for replacing
commonly-used commands and switches

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:15.585
with a shorter command,
or alias, that we define.

00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:20.051
In other words, an alias is a command
that we define ourselves,

00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:22.285
built from other commands.

00:00:23.378 --> 00:00:27.511
For example, we typically tend
to use ls -la

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:32.145
to display results in a long list,
including hidden files.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:36.045
Letâ€™s take a look at how we can
use an alias to replace this command:

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:39.558
By defining our own command, lsa, 

00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:45.525
we can quickly execute ls -la without
having to type any arguments at all.

00:00:46.658 --> 00:00:51.525
We can see the list of defined aliases
by running alias without arguments.
