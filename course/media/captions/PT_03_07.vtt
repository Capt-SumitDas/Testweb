Powercat Bind Shells

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:08.622
We can also use Powercat to start
a bind shell on Bob’s computer.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.655
We’ll use the -l option to
create a listener

00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:19.522
and -p to specify the
listening port number.

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:27.022
Then we use the familiar -e option
to execute cmd.exe once connected.

00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:31.760
Finally, Alice will create
a Netcat connection

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.193
to the bind shell on Bob’s computer.

00:00:38.484 --> 00:00:43.651
Excellent, we have yet another
alternative to standard Netcat shells.
