00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:05.600
Exploitation (Or Just Logging In)

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.866
Now that we have a higher degree of
confidence that Windows is running on

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:16.800
this host and we found that RDP is open,
we will use xfreerdp to connect to it.

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:26.400
As we did with Nmap, we have to prepend
xfreerdp with the proxychains command.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:33.933
We'll provide the domain and user name
with the /d and /u flags respectively.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.566
In order to redirect the clipboard,
we will use the clipboard flag,

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:43.800
which will allow us to
copy and paste to Poultry.

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:48.366
Finally, we also provide
the host with the /v flag.

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.033
Next, we will be prompted
for a password,

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.733
which we discovered in
the system report script.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:08.966
The credentials worked and we are
presented with a Windows 7 desktop.
