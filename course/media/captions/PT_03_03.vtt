00:00:01.926 --> 00:00:04.226
PowerShell Bind Shells

00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:08.590
This process is reversed when
dealing with bind shells.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.459
We first create the bind shell through
PowerShell on Bob’s computer,

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.026
and then use Netcat to connect
to it from Alice’s.

00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:20.377
As with the reverse shell,

00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:24.477
this complex command can be
broken down into several parts.

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:28.759
In addition to the client, stream
and byte variables,

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.426
we also have a new listener variable

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:36.659
that uses the System Net Sockets
TcpListener class.

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:42.375
This class requires two arguments:
the listening address and port

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.393
As with the reverse shell, we once again
use the iex cmdlet to execute our commands

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:57.595
In this command, we will again pass our
command to powershell using the -c option.

00:00:59.644 --> 00:01:03.511
With the bind shell listening, we can
connect to it from Alice’s machine

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:06.529
using Netcat as we would
with any other shell.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.993
PowerShell is ridiculously powerful

00:01:14.993 --> 00:01:19.059
and we’re not even close to scratching
the surface in terms of its functionality.

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:24.044
Due to Microsoft’s increasing
use of PowerShell

00:01:24.044 --> 00:01:27.411
for Windows-based
administration and automation,

00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:31.077
knowing how to properly use PowerShell
to achieve our goals

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:33.244
is extremely important.
