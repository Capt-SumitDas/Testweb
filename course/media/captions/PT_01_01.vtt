00:00:01.293 --> 00:00:04.359
Connecting to a TCP/UDP Port

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:08.629
Netcat can run in either
client or server mode.

00:00:11.214 --> 00:00:15.448
We can use client mode to connect
to any TCP or UDP port.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:21.033
Let’s use Netcat to check if TCP
port 110 is open on a remote machine.

00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:24.329
Here, we are supplying
several arguments.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.096
The -n option is used to skip
DNS name resolution

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:31.296
and -v specifies verbose output.

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:36.044
We then specify the destination
IP address and port number.

00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:41.711
After pressing Enter, Netcat
tells us several things.

00:00:41.978 --> 00:00:45.378
First, the TCP connection to
port 110 succeeded,

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:48.611
so Netcat reports the
remote port as open.

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:53.759
Next, the server responded to our
connection by “talking back to us”.

00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:57.944
It printed out the server welcome
message, and prompted us to log in, 

00:00:57.944 --> 00:01:01.078
which is standard behavior
for POP3 services.

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:03.959
Let’s try to interact with the
server by attempting to

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.493
authenticate as the offsec user.

00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:16.014
Our login attempt failed but we have
successfully managed to converse

00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:18.781
with the POP3 service using Netcat.
