Powercat

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:07.036
Powercat is essentially the
PowerShell version of Netcat.

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:10.169
It’s a script we can download
to a Windows host

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:14.136
which simplifies the creation of
bind and reverse shells.

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:29.054
After lauching PowerShell, we use a
feature known as Dot-sourcing

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:34.887
to load the powercat.ps1 script into
our current PowerShell session.

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:39.218
It’s worth noting that scripts
loaded in this way

00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:42.818
will only be available in the
current PowerShell instance

00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:47.085
and will need to be reloaded
each time we restart PowerShell.

00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:52.054
Now that our script is loaded,
we can execute powercat as follows:

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:57.769
We can view the help menu by
passing the -h option to Powercat.

00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:03.736
Powercat seems to be operating correctly
so let’s find out what we can do with it.
