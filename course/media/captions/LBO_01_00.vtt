About DEP, ASLR, and Canaries

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.333
Recent Linux kernels and compilers have
implemented various memory protection

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:14.266
techniques such as Data Execution
Prevention,


00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:19.200
Address Space Layout Randomization, and
Stck Canaries.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.300
Since the bypass of these protection
mechanisms is beyond the scope of this

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.866
module, our test version of Crossfire has
been compiled without them.
