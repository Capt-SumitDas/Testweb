00:00:01.346 --> 00:00:03.500
Web Application Enumeration

00:00:04.286 --> 00:00:08.366
It is important to identify the components
that make up a web application

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.233
before attempting to blindly exploit it.

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:16.566
Many web application vulnerabilities
are technology-agnostic.

00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:19.333
However, some exploits and payloads

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.833
need to be crafted based on the
technological underpinnings

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.000
of the application,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.400
such as the database software
or operating system.

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:32.266
Before launching any attacks
on a web application,

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:36.133
we should attempt to discover
the technology stack in use,

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.533
which generally consists of
the following components:

00:00:42.022 --> 00:00:44.433
Programming language and frameworks,

00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:46.900
Web server software,

00:00:47.824 --> 00:00:49.366
Database software,

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.166
and Server operating system

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.933
There are several techniques that we can
use to gather this information directly

00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.133
from the browser.

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:04.166
Most modern browsers
include developer tools

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.900
that can assist in the
enumeration process.

00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:10.100
We will be focusing on
Firefox since it is the default

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.900
browser in Kali Linux

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.500
but most browsers include
similar developer tools.
