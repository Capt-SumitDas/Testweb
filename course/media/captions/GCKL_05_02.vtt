00:00:01.402 --> 00:00:04.066
HTTP Service

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:09.466
The Apache HTTP service is often used 
during a penetration test, either for 

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:15.233
hosting a site, or providing a platform 
for downloading files to a victim machine.

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:21.066
The HTTP service is TCP-based and 
listens by default on port 80.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:26.866
To start the HTTP service in Kali, we 
can use systemCTL as we did when starting 

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:31.540
the SSH service, replacing the service 
name with “apache2”.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.700
As with the SSH service, we can verify 
that the HTTP service is running and 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.233
listening on TCP port 80 with ss and grep.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.633
To have the HTTP service start at boot 
time, much like with the SSH service, 

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:51.866
we need to explicitly enable it with 
 systemCTL and its enable option.

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:57.400
Most services in Kali Linux are operated 
in much the same way as SSH and HTTP

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.233
through their service or init scripts.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:04.466
To see a table of all available services, 
run systemCTL 

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:08.100
with the list-unit-files option:

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.766
For additional information regarding 
service management in Kali Linux, 

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:19.133
including the use of systemCTL, 
refer to the Kali Training site.
