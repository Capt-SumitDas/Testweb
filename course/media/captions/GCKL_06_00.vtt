00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:05.733
Searching, Installing, and Removing Tools

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.533
The default Kali release contains the 
most common tools used 

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.433
in the field of penetration testing.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:15.566
However, itâ€™s not practical to include 
every single tool present 

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.700
in the Kali repository in the 
default release.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.933
In this section, we will be exploring 
the Advanced Package Tool toolset

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:28.033
as well as other commands to 
search for, install, or remove tools.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.266
APT is a set of tools that helps 
manage packages, 

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.666
or applications, on a Debian-based 
system.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:40.333
Since Kali is based on Debian, we can use 
APT to install and remove applications,

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:44.433
update packages, and even upgrade 
the entire system.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:49.433
The magic of APT lies in the fact that it 
is a complete package management system 

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.500
that installs or removes the requested 
package

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.433
by recursively satisfying its 
requirements and dependencies.
