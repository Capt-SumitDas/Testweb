00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:03.766
Active Directory Theory

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:07.780
Active Directory consists of several
components with the most

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.746
important being the
domain controller (DC).

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:16.233
The domain controller is the hub
and core of Active Directory

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:19.500
because it stores all information
about how the specific

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.466
instance of Active
Directory is configured.

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:28.400
It also enforces various sets of rules
that govern how objects within the domain

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.933
interact with each other,

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:34.233
and what services and tools
are available to end users.

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:41.433
When an instance of Active Directory
is configured, a domain is created

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:48.100
with a name such as corp.com where
corp is the name of the organization.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.800
Within this domain, we can add
various types of objects,

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:55.533
including computer and user objects.

00:00:55.913 --> 00:00:59.207
System administrators usually organize
these objects with the help of

00:00:59.207 --> 00:01:05.800
Organizational Units (OU), which are
comparable to file system folders

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.133
in that they are containers used
to store and group other objects.

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:16.233
Computer objects represent actual
servers and workstations

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:21.100
that are part of the domain,
also referred to as domain-joined,

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:26.333
and user objects represent
employees in the organization.

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:35.666
All AD objects contain attributes, which
vary according to the type of object.

00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:41.166
For example, a user object may
include attributes such as first name, 

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.866
last name, username, and password.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:51.308
Typically, client computers on an
internal network are connected

00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:56.233
to the domain controller and to
various other internal member servers

00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:00.966
such as database servers,
file storage servers, and so forth.

00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:05.966
In addition, many organizations have
Internet-connected web servers

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:09.366
 which sometimes are also
members of the internal domain.

00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:12.800
Active Directory can be intimidating

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.900
as it includes many concepts and
features that we can’t fully cover.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.100
Instead, we’ll introduce basic
AD terms and language

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.266
and provide you with additional
knowledge required

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:28.666
to perform enumeration
and exploitation.
