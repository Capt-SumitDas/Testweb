00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.333
Scanning with Individual Nessus Plugins

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.433
By default,

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:10.333
Nessus will enable a number
of plugins behind-the-scenes

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.166
when running a default template.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.333
While this is certainly
useful in many scenarios,

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.266
we can also fine-tune our options to,

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.433
for example,

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:21.900
quickly run a single plugin.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.000
We can use this feature to
validate a previous finding

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.433
or to quickly discover

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.866
all the targets vulnerable to a
specific exploit in an environment.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
For this example,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.433
we will run the NFS Exported Share
Information Disclosure plugin

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:41.300
against the “Beta” host in the lab.

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:45.900
We can use this plugin to gather
information from the RPC server

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.266
on port 111

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:51.733
and validate if the target is
exporting any NFS shares.

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:56.900
To run a scan for a single plugin,
we will once again begin with a New Scan.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:03.400
This time, we will use
the Advanced Scan template.


00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.400
Unlike the templates
that we used previously,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.333
the Advanced Scan template

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:12.300
does not use recommendations
for scan configurations.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.400
This template does, however,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.000
offer a set of “Advanced” defaults

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.600
that are typically hidden

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.166
or unavailable to other templates.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.233
The Advanced Scan also
allows us to select

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.000
individual plug-ins,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.633
an option that is not available
to most other templates.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.500
We’ll begin by configuring
the scan name and targets.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.933
To save time and scan more quietly,

00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.100
we will turn off

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.300
Host discovery,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.500
since we know the host is available.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.633
We will do this
by clicking on “Discovery”,

00:01:56.173 --> 00:01:59.733
and deselecting “Ping the remote host”.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.300
In addition to disabling host discovery,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.333
we can also narrow the scanned port list

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:12.766
if we already know what
port the service is running on.

00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:16.566
Since we are scanning the
RPC service and we know that RPC

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:19.833
is in fact running on TCP port 111,

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:22.200
we will only scan this port.

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.182
To set this up, we’ll select
“Port Scanning” under “Discovery”,

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:34.000
and enter “111” into the
“Port scan range” field.

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:43.466
We will also uncheck all options under the
“Local Port Enumerators” section as well.

00:02:47.224 --> 00:02:49.900
With some of the scan
options slimmed down,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.866
we can begin to select the plugins.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.766
We’ll start by clicking “Disable All”
so we can start with a clean slate.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:06.466
At this point, the scan will run
very quickly, but won’t do much!

00:03:06.908 --> 00:03:09.200
To scan for open NFS shares,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.566
we’ll navigate to
“RPC” in the left column,

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:20.500
and set “NFS Exported
Share Information Disclosure”

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.400
 in the right column to Enabled.

00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:30.933
Now that the scan is configured,
we are ready to launch it.

00:03:39.732 --> 00:03:41.400
Once the scan is completed,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.400
we can click on the scan name,
then on Beta’s IP

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.433
to open the list of
discovered vulnerabilities.

00:03:49.737 --> 00:03:53.100
Navigating to the single critical
vulnerability and clicking on it

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.033
displays a detailed page showing
all the exported NFS shares.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.766
Note that the scan also generated
two additional info plugin outputs.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.066
These include details about the
scan and the result of the SYN scan.
