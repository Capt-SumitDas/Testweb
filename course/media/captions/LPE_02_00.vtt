Searching for Exploits

00:00:04.747 --> 00:00:09.547
After the information gathering and
enumeration stages of a penetration test,

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:14.580
we can cross-check discovered
software for known vulnerabilities

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.914
in an attempt to find published
exploits for those vulnerabilities.
