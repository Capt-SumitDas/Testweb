Expanding Your Repertoire

00:00:04.947 --> 00:00:07.000
Now that we’ve walked through the basics,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.266
let’s look at some ways
to expand our repertoire.

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:14.300
First, let’s look at some
Apache alternatives.

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:19.433
Kali includes several tools
that can create HTTP servers.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.529
This is especially helpful

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.800
if we need to quickly stand up
HTTP servers on arbitrary ports.

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.994
For example, we can start an HTTP server

00:00:31.994 --> 00:00:35.866
on an arbitrary port in Python 2.x

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:43.466
by using the SimpleHTTPServer module
followed by the desired TCP port number.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.766
The syntax is slightly different with 
Python 3 as the module name is different.

00:00:55.423 --> 00:00:58.133
Both commands will start an HTTP server

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:02.800
and host any files or directories
from the current working path.

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:11.400
PHP includes a built-in web server

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.600
that can be launched with the -S flag

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.900
followed by the address and port to use.

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:25.866
We can also launch an HTTP server
with a Ruby “one liner”.

00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:32.500
The command requires
several flags including -run

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.893
to load un.rb,

00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:38.766
which contains replacements
for common Unix commands,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.533
-e httpd to run the HTTP server,

00:01:45.802 --> 00:01:49.333
a dot to serve content
from the current directory

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.100
and -p to set the TCP port.

00:02:00.175 --> 00:02:03.266
We can also use busybox
to run an HTTP server

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:05.933
with httpd as the function,

00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:09.566
-f to run interactively

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:14.466
and -p to specify the TCP port to use.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.600
Next, let’s discuss PHP wrappers.
