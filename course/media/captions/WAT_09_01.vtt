00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.833
Basic SQL Syntax

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:07.987
Structured Query Language
is the primary language

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:11.166
used to interact with relational databases.

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:14.433
While there is a standard syntax for SQL,

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:19.666
most database software packages
have implementation variations.

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:23.166
However, the basics
are generally the same.

00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:27.533
Let’s walk through some
basic SQL concepts and syntax

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:31.000
to get a feel for it before
moving on to exploitation.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:35.433
A relational database is
made up of one or more tables

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:38.800
and each table has one or more columns.

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:42.866
Each entry in a table is called a row.

00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:48.433
In this table, the columns are
id, username, and password.

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.733
There is one row of data for a user

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:57.533
with the username of tom.jones
and a password of notunusual.

00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.966
In most cases,
we will be dealing with queries.

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:03.966
Queries are instructions
to the database engine

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:08.900
and we use them to retrieve or
manipulate data in the database.

00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:13.133
A SELECT query is the most basic interaction.

00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:18.333
For example, we can
paraphrase this query as

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:22.800
“show all columns and
records in the users table”.

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:26.600
The first argument to the
SELECT command is a column

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.833
and the asterisk is a special
character that means “all”.

00:01:32.067 --> 00:01:36.733
We also have the option of introducing
a conditional clause to our query

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.833
with a WHERE clause.

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:41.766
We can paraphrase this query as

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:45.733
“show the username field
from the users table,

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:50.066
displaying only records with an id of 1”.

00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:55.500
These are just some of the basics.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.800
We can also
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data in tables.

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:02.800
We won’t cover those statements here,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.900
but as we show how
to exploit SQL injection,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.566
we will cover additional
SQL syntax as needed.
