00:00:01.192 --> 00:00:02.366
Masscan

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:07.881
Masscan can scan the entire Internet
in about 6 minutes,

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:13.366
transmitting an astounding
10 million packets per second.

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:16.933
While it was originally designed
to scan the entire Internet,

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:20.733
it can easily handle
a class A or B subnet,

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.633
which is a more suitable target
range during a penetration test.

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.366
Masscan is not installed
on Kali by default;

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.600
it must be installed using apt install.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.633
Since masscan implements
a custom TCP/IP stack

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:47.166
and requires access to raw sockets,

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.100
we must run it as sudo.

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:54.900
To try masscan on a class C subnet
in the PWK internal lab network,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.266
we can use the following example. 

00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:02.133
However, this is presented
as an example only.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.333
Do not run this within the lab.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.333
We use the rate option to specify the
desired rate of packet transmission…

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:15.000
…-e to specify the raw
network interface to use,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.733
which is our VPN interface
in this example… 

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:24.133
…and router-ip to specify the
IP address for the appropriate gateway.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.700
Within a few seconds, we have the results of our scan.
