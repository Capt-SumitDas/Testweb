00:00:01.804 --> 00:00:04.000
Inspecting Page Content

00:00:05.253 --> 00:00:06.900
Although URL inspection

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.000
can provide some clues
about the target web application,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.533
most context clues can be found
in the source of the web page.

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:23.233
The Firefox Debugger tool,

00:00:23.717 --> 00:00:25.600
found in the Web Developer,

00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:33.033
displays the page’s resources and content,

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.133
which varies by application.

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:39.300
The Debugger tool may display JavaScript frameworks,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.433
hidden input fields, comments,
client-side controls within HTML,

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.666
JavaScript, and much more.

00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:50.900
To demonstrate this,
we can inspect the Debugger

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.466
while browsing
www.megacorp.one:

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:06.333
We can see that the application
uses jQuery version 1.11.0,

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.233
a common JavaScript library.

00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:18.633
In this case, the developer
minified the code,

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.933
making it more compact
and conserving resources

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.600
but making it somewhat difficult to read.

00:01:25.246 --> 00:01:27.933
Fortunately, we can “prettify” code

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:32.145
within Firefox by clicking on
the Pretty print source button

00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:34.100
with the double curly braces:

00:01:35.318 --> 00:01:36.900
After clicking the icon,

00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:45.300
Firefox displays the code in a format
that is easier to read and follow.

00:01:46.207 --> 00:01:51.133
We can also use the Inspector tool to
drill down into specific page content.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.700
Let’s use Inspector to examine the email
input element from the “Contact” page

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.366
by right-clicking the
email address field on the page,

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:12.800
and selecting Inspect Element.

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:19.966
This opens the Inspector tool

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:23.566
and highlights the HTML
for the element we selected.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.866
This tool is especially useful

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:30.500
for quickly finding hidden
form fields in the HTML source.
