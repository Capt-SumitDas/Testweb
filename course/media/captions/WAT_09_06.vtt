00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.766
Understanding the Layout of the Output

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:08.122
Now that we know how many
columns are in the table,

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:13.033
we can use this information to extract
further data with a UNION statement.

00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:20.865
Unions allow us to add a second select
statement to the original query,

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:22.800
extending our capability,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.066
but each select statement must
return the same number of columns.

00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:32.700
We know the query selects three
columns based on our enumeration.

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.733
However, only two columns are
displayed on the webpage.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.533
Our next step is to determine
which columns are displayed.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.733
If we use a union to extract useful data,

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.600
we want to make sure the
data will be displayed.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.133
We need to better understand our output

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:54.066
so we can begin to build a
meaningful database extraction.

00:00:54.573 --> 00:00:59.333
First, let’s get an idea of which columns
are being displayed in the page.

00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:01.766
We will use a UNION to do this.

00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:07.366
We can specify literal values instead
of looking up values from a table.

00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:14.366
Since we have three columns,

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:20.866
we will add “union all select
1, 2, 3” to our payload.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.866
This new select state will return one row

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:29.933
with three columns with
values of 1, 2, and 3.

00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:34.433
We can see that column one isn’t displayed,

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:37.600
column two is displayed in the name field,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.300
and column three is displayed in the Comment field.

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:44.333
The Comment field has more space

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:48.766
so this is a logical spot for our
future exploit’s output.
