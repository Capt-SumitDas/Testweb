Locating Administration Consoles

00:00:06.132 --> 00:00:10.633
Web servers often ship with remote
administration web applications,

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:12.100
or consoles,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.000
which are accessible via a particular URL

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.400
and often listen on a specific TCP port.

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:23.733
Two common examples are the
manager application for Tomcat

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:27.533
and phpMyAdmin for MySQL.

00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:31.366
While these consoles can be
restricted to local access

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.100
or may be hosted on custom TCP ports,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.800
we often find them externally exposed
by default configurations.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.166
As penetration testers, we should
check the default console locations,

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:47.733
identified in the application server
software documentation.

00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:51.366
In the following section, we will also
demonstrate tools that can be used

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.800
to automate the search for these consoles

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.900
and in a later section we will
demonstrate exploitation techniques.
