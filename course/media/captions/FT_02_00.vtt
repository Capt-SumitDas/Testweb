Transferring Files with Windows Hosts

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:10.400
In Unix-like environments, we’ll often 
find tools such as Netcat, curl,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.266
or wget preinstalled with the 
operating system, 

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:19.200
which make downloading files from a 
remote machine relatively simple.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.866
However, on Windows machines the 
process is usually not as straightforward.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.100
In this section, we’ll explore file 
transfer options 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.300
on Windows-based machines.
