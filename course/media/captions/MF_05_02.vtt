Migrating Processes

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:09.266
When we compromise a host, our
Meterpreter payload is executed

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:13.333
inside the process of the
application we attack.

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:19.033
If the victim closes that process, our
access to the machine is closed as well.

00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:22.560
Using the migrate command,
we can move the execution

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.800
of our Meterpreter to
different processes.

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:31.766
To do this, we first run “ps”
to view all running processes.

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:40.500
Then we pick one, like explorer.exe,

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:50.700
and issue the migrate command followed by
the process id of explorer.exe.

00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:04.920
Note that we are only
able to migrate into a process

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.573
executing at the same privilege
and integrity level

00:01:09.573 --> 00:01:13.366
or lower than that of our current process
