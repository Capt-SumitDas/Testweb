00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.733
Viewing Response Headers

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.666
We can also search server responses
for additional information.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:12.900
There are two types of tools we can use to accomplish this task.

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.533
The first type of tool is a proxy,

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.433
which intercepts requests and responses

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.833
between a client and a webserver.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.933
We will explore proxies
later in this module,

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.200
but first we will explore
the Firefox Network tool

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.166
to view HTTP requests and responses.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.400
This tool shows network activity
that occurs after it launches,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.433
so we might need to
refresh the page to see traffic.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.700
We can click on a request
to get more details about it,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.066
in this case the response headers:

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:13.400
The “Server” header will often reveal
the name of the web server software

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.433
and sometimes, the version number.

00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:33.166
Headers that start with “X-”
are non-standard HTTP headers.

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.000
The names or values often reveal

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.066
additional information about the
technology stack used by the application.

00:01:41.628 --> 00:01:43.066
Further research into these names

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.900
could reveal additional
useful information.
