00:00:01.427 --> 00:00:02.127
comm

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:05.894
The comm command compares two text files,

00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:08.994
displaying the lines that are unique
to each one,

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:11.461
as well as the lines they have in common.

00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:18.646
In the first example,

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:23.579
comm displayed the unique lines
in scan-a.txt,

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.346
the unique lines in scan-b.txt

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:30.779
and the lines found in both
files respectively.

00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:35.127
Comm outputs three
space-offset columns:

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:39.627
the first contains lines that are
unique to the first file or argument;

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:44.876
the second contains lines that are
unique to the second file or argument;

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:49.009
and the third column contains lines
that are shared by both files.

00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:55.343
The -n switch, where “n” is either
1, 2, or 3,

00:00:55.343 --> 00:00:59.876
can be used to suppress one or more
columns, depending on the need.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.809
Let’s take a look at an example:

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:08.494
This time, comm displayed only the
lines that were found in both files

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:11.127
since we suppressed columns
one and two.
