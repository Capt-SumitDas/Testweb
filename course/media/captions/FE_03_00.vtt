00:00:01.676 --> 00:00:02.533
Wrapping Up

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:08.966
In this module, we covered the main
segments of a plain stack buffer overflow

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:13.400
that required extensive editing
to match our target environment.

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:15.800
We then cross-compiled the code

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.233
in order to make it run on
our Kali attack platform.

00:00:20.173 --> 00:00:25.066
We also modified a web exploit to
demonstrate how these types of exploits

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.966
can be re-purposed for a
different target environment.

00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:31.633
These scenarios reveal solutions

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:34.700
to common obstacles encountered
when dealing with

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.333
public exploits during an engagement.
