Netcat

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:07.204
Netcat is one of the original
network penetration testing tools

00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:10.941
and is so versatile that it
lives up it’s designation as

00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:13.475
a hacker’s “Swiss army knife”.

00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.258
Netcat reads and writes data across
network connections

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:20.491
using TCP or UDP protocols.
