Changing the Socket Information

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:09.800
We already know that this exploit targets
a remotely-accessible vulnerability

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.800
which means that our code needs to
establish a connection to the target

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.133
at some point.

00:00:24.653 --> 00:00:26.133
Inspecting the C code,

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.633
we notice that it uses hard coded
values for the IP address

00:00:31.018 --> 00:00:33.166
as well as the for port

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:38.800
These will be the first values that
we will need to adjust in our exploit.
