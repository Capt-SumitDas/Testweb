00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.500
Web Application Assessment Methodology

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.766
Before we begin discussing
enumeration and exploitation,

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:15.133
we will talk about the basic web application
penetration testing methodology.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.666
As a first step, we should gather
information about the application.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.733
What does the application do?

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.566
What language is it written in?

00:00:28.772 --> 00:00:32.566
What server software is
the application running on?

00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:36.000
The answers to these
and other basic questions

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.366
will help guide us towards our first
(or next) potential attack vector.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.466
As with many
penetration testing disciplines,

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.700
the goal of each attempted attack
or exploit

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.666
is to increase our permissions
within the application

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:57.200
or pivot to another
application or target.

00:00:57.956 --> 00:01:00.433
Each successful exploit along the way

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:03.500
may grant access to new functionality

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.233
or components within the application.

00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:09.300
Enumeration of new functionality

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.366
is important each step of the way

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:14.400
especially since attacks
that previously failed

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.266
may succeed in a new context.

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:19.433
As penetration testers,

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:21.433
we must continue to enumerate

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:23.466
and adapt until weâ€™ve exhausted

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.166
all attack avenues

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.533
or compromised the system.
