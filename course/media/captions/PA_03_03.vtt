SSH Attack with THC-Hydra

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:11.000
THC-Hydra is another powerful network 
service attack tool 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.566
under active development and it is 
worth mastering.

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:18.833
We can use it to attack a variety of 
protocol authentication schemes, 

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:22.700
including SSH and HTTP.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.428
The standard options include -l to 
specify the target username, 

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:35.766
-P to specify a wordlist, and the 
protocol and IP in URI format

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:41.166
to specify the target protocol and IP 
address, respectively

00:00:42.277 --> 00:00:47.800
In this first example, we’ll attack the 
SSH service on our Kali VM.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.266
Let’s start OpenSSH before proceeding.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:01:00.800
Now we’ll use hydra to attack the SSH 
protocol on our local machine,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.600
focus on the kali user,

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:08.300
and again use the small wordlist 
we created earlier.

00:01:11.368 --> 00:01:15.160
In this output, we can see that hydra 
discovered a valid login 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.566
against the local SSH server.

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:23.533
THC-Hydra supports a number of standard
protocols and services.

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:29.933
Refer to the hydra man page to view all
of its available options.
