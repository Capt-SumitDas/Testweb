00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:04.233
The SNMP MIB Tree

00:00:05.143 --> 00:00:10.566
The SNMP Management Information Base
is a database containing information

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.166
usually related to network management.

00:00:14.588 --> 00:00:16.766
The database is organized like a tree,

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:21.666
where branches represent different
organizations or network functions.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:23.933
The leaves of the tree

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.833
correspond to specific variable values
that can then be accessed,

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.333
and probed, by an external user.

00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:33.466
For example, these MIB values

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:37.866
correspond to specific
Microsoft Windows SNMP parameters

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:41.666
and contains much more than
network-based information.
