curl

00:00:03.012 --> 00:00:09.245
Curl is a tool used to transfer data to or
from a server using a host of protocols,

00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:13.774
A penetration tester can use curl
to download or upload files 

00:00:13.774 --> 00:00:16.108
and build complex requests.

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:19.508
Its most basic use is very similar to wget

00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:23.808
but with a lower-case o to specify
the output filename.

00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:27.916
Curl is incredibly versatile

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:32.150
and you'll find ample documentation
and example usage online.
