Exploiting Microsoft Office

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.187
When leveraging client-side
vulnerabilities it's important to use

00:00:08.187 --> 00:00:13.387
applications that are trusted by the
victim in their every-day line of work.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.987
Unlike potentially suspicious-
looking web links,

00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:19.820
Microsoft Office client-side attacks

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.187
are often successful because it is difficult
to differentiate malicious content

00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:26.454
from benign.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.866
In this section, we will explore
various client-side attack vectors that

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.100
leverage Microsoft Office applications.
