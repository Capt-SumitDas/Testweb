nano

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:05.966
Nano is one of the simplest-to-use 
text editors.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.166
To open a file and begin editing, 

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:13.433
simply run nano, passing a filename
as an optional argument:

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.066
Once the file is opened,

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.900
we can immediately start making any
required changes to the file

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.133
just as we would in a graphical editor.

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.700
The nano command menu is located at
the bottom of the screen.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:29.100
Some of the most-used commands
to memorize include

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.600
control-o to write changes to the file…


00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.600
Control-k to cut the current line…

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:41.266
And control-u to un-cut a line and
paste it at the cursor location.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.566
Control-w is used to search
within the file..

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:49.500
And finally, control-x is
used to exit.

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:54.633

regarding nano,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.100
