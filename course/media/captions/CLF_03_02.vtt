00:00:01.337 --> 00:00:02.437
sed

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:06.407
Sed is a powerful stream editor.

00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:11.207
It is also very complex so we’ll only
briefly scratch the surface here.

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:12.428
At a high level,

00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:16.149
sed performs text editing on
a stream of text,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.416
either a set of specific files

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:20.416
or standard output.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:22.428
Let’s look at an example:

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:28.061
We created a stream of text using
the echo command

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.028
and then piped it to sed

00:00:30.028 --> 00:00:33.661
in order to replace the word “hard”
with “harder.”

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:37.595
Note that by default, the output
of the entire command has been

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:40.461
automatically redirected to
the standard output.

00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:42.428
or, the terminal screen.
