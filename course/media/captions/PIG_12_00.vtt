00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.833
Social Media Tools

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:09.600
Just about all organizations now maintain
some sort of presence on Social Media.

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:15.133
The information a company posts on social
media can be very useful for us.

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:20.066
We could, for example, use this
information to identify potential

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:25.800
employees and gain more information about
the company and its operations.

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.966
There are various ways to gather this
public information with several tools

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:34.166
we have already discussed, such as
recon-ng and theHarvester.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.966
Let’s explore a few additional tools.

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.266
Social-Searcher

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.466
Social-Searcher is a search engine for
social media sites.

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:58.300
A free account will allow a limited
number of searches per day.

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:03.633
Social-searcher can be a quick alternative
to setting up API keys

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:06.966
on multiple more specialized services.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.366
The search results will include
information posted by the target

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:27.266
organization and what people are saying
about it.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:31.966
Among other things, this can help us
determine what sort of footprint

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:36.233
and coverage an organization has on
social media.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.033
Once we’ve done this, we may choose to
move on to using site-specific tools.
