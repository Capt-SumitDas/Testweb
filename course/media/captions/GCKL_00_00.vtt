00:00:01.511 --> 00:00:04.511
Getting Comfortable with Kali Linux

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.966
Kali Linux is developed, funded,
and maintained by Offensive Security.

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:13.177
It contains several hundred tools that 
are geared towards various 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.193
information security tasks, such as
Penetration Testing, Security research, 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.333
Computer Forensics and Reverse 
Engineering.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.666
The goal of this module is to provide 
a baseline and prepare you 

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.833
for the upcoming modules, 
regardless of your skill level.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:31.300
Take time to appropriately focus 
on this module and accept 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.833
Abraham Lincoln’s advice. He once said, 
“Give me six hours to chop down a tree,

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:40.966
and I will spend the first four 
sharpening the axe.”
