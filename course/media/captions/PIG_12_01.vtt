Site-Specific Tools

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:09.733
There are two site-specific tools that we
may want to familiarize ourselves with.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.200
Twofi scans a userâ€™s Twitter feed and
generates a personalized wordlist

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.766
 used for password attacks against that
user.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:28.066
While we will not run any attacks during
passive information gathering,

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:32.100
we can run this tool against any Twitter
accounts we have identified

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.933
to have a wordlist ready when needed.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.233
Twofi requires a valid Twitter API key.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.966
linkedin2username

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:50.366
is a script for generating username lists
based on LinkedIn data.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:57.233
It requires valid LinkedIn credentials and
depends on a LinkedIn connection

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.200
to individuals in the target organization.

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:05.566
The script will output usernames in
several different formats.
