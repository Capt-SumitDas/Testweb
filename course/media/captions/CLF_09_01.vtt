Bash History Customization

00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:07.523
Earlier in this module, we
discussed environment variables

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:09.155
and the history command.

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:11.656
We can use a number of environment
variables to change

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:15.289
how the history command
operates and returns data,

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:21.821
the most common include HISTCONTROL, 
HISTIGNORE, and HISTTIMEFORMAT.

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:25.590
The HISTCONTROL variable

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.990
defines whether or not to
remove duplicate commands,

00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:32.923
commands that begin with spaces
from the history, or both.

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:35.587
By default, both are removed

00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:39.587
but you may find it more useful
to only omit duplicate commands.

00:00:39.988 --> 00:00:44.455
The HISTIGNORE variable is particularly
useful for filtering out basic commands

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:51.255
that are run frequently, such as
ls, exit, history, bg, etc.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:57.456
Letâ€™s run a few commands to see if
history ignores our specified commands.

00:01:07.988 --> 00:01:13.555
As expected the ls and history commands
do not appear in our command history.

00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:17.421
Lastly, HISTTIMEFORMAT

00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:22.721
controls date and/or time stamps
in the output of the history command.

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:33.889
In this example, we used %F
(or Year-Month-Day ISO 8601 format)

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.923
and %T (24-hour time).

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:44.453
Other formats can be found in the
str-f-time man page.
