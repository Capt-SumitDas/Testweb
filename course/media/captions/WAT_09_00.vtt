00:00:01.664 --> 00:00:03.166
SQL Injection

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:08.533
SQL Injection is a common
web application vulnerability

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:12.233
that is caused by unsanitized user input

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:14.800
being inserted into queries

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.900
and subsequently passed
to a database for execution.

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:21.866
Queries are used to
interact with a database,

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.966
such as inserting or retrieving data.

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:28.866
If we can inject malicious
input into a query,

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:32.966
we can “break out” of the original
query made by the developers

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.333
and introduce our own malicious actions.

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:40.833
These types of vulnerabilities can
lead to database information leakage

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:43.033
and, depending on the environment,

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.400
could lead to complete server compromise.

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:49.600
In this section,
we will examine SQL injection attacks

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.633
under a PHP/MariaDB environment.

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:57.133
While the concepts are the
same for other environments,

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.500
the syntax used during an attack

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.166
may need to be updated to accommodate
different database engines

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.300
or scripting languages.
