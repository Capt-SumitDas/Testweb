00:00:01.672 --> 00:00:03.733
Web Application Attacks

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:09.933
In this module, we will focus on the
identification and exploitation of common

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.566
web application vulnerabilities.

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:16.266
Web applications can be written
in a variety of programming languages

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.760
and frameworks,

00:00:17.953 --> 00:00:22.133
each of which can introduce
specific types of vulnerabilities.

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.766
However, the most common vulnerabilities
are similar in concept,

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:30.200
regardless of the underlying
technology stack.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.166
Although the complexity of
vulnerabilities and attacks vary,

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.033
we will demonstrate the
exploitation of several

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:42.800
common web application vulnerabilities
listed in the OWASP Top 10 list.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.354
These attack vectors will serve
as the basic building blocks

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:49.466
used to construct more advanced attacks.
