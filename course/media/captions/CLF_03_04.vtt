00:00:01.494 --> 00:00:02.327
awk

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:06.647
awk is programming language 
designed for text processing

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:10.533
and is typically used as a data
extraction and reporting tool.

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:14.262
It is also extremely powerful and can
be quite complex,

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:17.129
so again we will only scratch
the surface here.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.100
A commonly used switch with awk is -F,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.267
which is the field separator,

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:27.366
and the print command,
which outputs the result text.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.333
Here we echoed a line, 
and piped it to awk

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.033
to extract the first and third fields

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.400
using a double-colon as a
field separator.

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:42.606
The most prominent difference between
the cut and awk examples we used,

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:47.373
is that cut can only accept a single
character as a field delimiter,

00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:50.039
while awk is much more flexible.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.933
As a general rule of thumb,

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:57.100
use a single awk command instead
of multiple cut operations.
