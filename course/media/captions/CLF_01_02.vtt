00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.915
Tab Completion

00:00:03.513 --> 00:00:07.080
The Bash shell auto-complete
function allows us to complete

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.980
filenames and directory paths
with the Tab key.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:15.758
This is such a time saver that makes
other shells, which lack this feature,

00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:17.800
feel clumsy and slow.

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:22.305
Let’s take a look at how this works
from the kali user home directory.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.672
We’ll start by typing the following
command:

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.189
When we hit the Tab key the first time
after “D”, Bash suggests that there are

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.755
three directories starting with that
letter then presents our

00:00:34.848 --> 00:00:37.582
partially completed command for us.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.437
Since we decide to specify “Desktop”,

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:43.970
we’ll type “e” followed
by the Tab key again.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.137
At this point the Bash shell magically
auto-completes the rest of the word

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:52.637
“Desktop” as this is the only
choice that starts with “De”.

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:56.125
