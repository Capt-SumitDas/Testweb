00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.833
Installation, Setup, and Usage

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:08.400
Empire is not included in the
Kali Linux repositories

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.900
 so we’ll need to install it manually.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.466
First, we need to clone the GitHub
repository under the opt directory.

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.611
We can then install Empire by running
the install script in the 

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:43.433
Empire setup directory.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.133
Empire allows for collaboration

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.866
between penetration testers
across multiple servers

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:06.333
using shared private keys and by
extension, shared passwords.


00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.633
Since we are installing a single instance, 

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:13.333
we’ll press Enter at the password prompt
to generate a random password.

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.366
With the framework installed,

00:01:18.372 --> 00:01:23.066
we can launch Empire with the aptly-named
Python script, empire.
