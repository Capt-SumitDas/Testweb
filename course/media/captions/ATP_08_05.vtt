00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.933
Post Exploitation Enumeration

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:09.466
We’ve already conducted some basic
enumeration against the Cevapi target.

00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:14.600
During this stage, we’ll concentrate on
getting closer to our stated goal,

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:16.566
Domain Admin.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:23.566
Earlier, we discovered that Cevapi is, in
fact, joined to the sandbox.local domain.

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.161
Let’s take a look to see if
any domain accounts

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.666
are logged in for us to
impersonate their tokens.

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:34.525
Similar to how we tested Poultry,
we will again use the incognito

00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:39.166
extension within meterpreter
to list all available tokens.

00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:52.900
It appears that the sandbox.local
administrator user is logged into Cevapi.

00:00:53.448 --> 00:00:58.566
Let’s try to impersonate this user to
verify that we can escalate our privileges

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:02.866
To do this, we will use the
impersonate_token command

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:06.033
and specify the Administrator user.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.022
We have to escape the backslash
character in order for

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:12.166
Metasploit to read the command correctly.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.533
Success! We are now running as
the sandbox administrator user.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.866
Next, we need to verify that this
is indeed an administrative user.

00:01:33.103 --> 00:01:38.333
Excellent! The administrator user
is part of the Domain Admins

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:42.133
and Enterprise Admins groups.
