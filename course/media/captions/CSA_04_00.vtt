Wrapping Up

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:06.362
Client-side attack vectors are
especially insidious

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:09.495
as they exploit weaknesses
in client software,

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:13.741
such as a browser, as opposed to
exploiting server software.

00:00:14.508 --> 00:00:18.675
This often involves some form of user
interaction and deception

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:22.341
in order for the client software
to execute malicious code

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:26.695
These attack vectors are particularly
appealing for an attacker

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:31.829
because they do not require direct or
routable access to the victim's machine.

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:36.062
In this module, we described some
of the factors that are important

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:38.095
to consider in this type of attack

00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:41.229
and walked through
exploitation scenarios

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:44.695
involving both malicious 
HTML Applications

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:47.495
and Microsoft Word documents.
