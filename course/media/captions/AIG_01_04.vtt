00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.566
Reverse Lookup Brute Force

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:10.166
Our DNS forward brute force enumeration
revealed a set of scattered IP addresses

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.533
in the same approximate range.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:16.966
If the DNS administrator
of megacorpone.com

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.066
configured PTR records for the domain,

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.800
we could scan the approximate
range with reverse lookups

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.733
to request the hostname for each IP.

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:32.300
Let’s use a loop to scan
IP addresses 50 through 100.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.066
We will use grep -v to
filter out invalid results

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:41.733
by showing only entries that do not
contain the “not found” message.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.333
We’ve successfully managed to resolve
a number of IP addresses to valid hosts

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.600
using reverse DNS lookups.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.833
If we were performing an assessment,

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:59.433
we could further extrapolate these results,
and might scan for “mail1”,

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:04.166
“mail3”, etc and reverse
lookup positive results.

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:10.000
The point is that these
types of scans are often cyclical;

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.200
we expand our search based on any
information we receive at every round.
