00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:04.625
Windows SNMP Enumeration Example

00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:08.766
We can probe and query SNMP values

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.533
using a tool such as snmpwalk

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:16.633
provided we at least know the
SNMP read-only community string,

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:19.066
which in most cases is “public”.

00:00:20.873 --> 00:00:23.400
Enumerating the Entire MIB Tree

00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:27.366
Using some of the MIB values we saw earlier,

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:31.100
we can attempt to enumerate
their corresponding values.

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:35.800
This command enumerates
the entire MIB tree

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.366
using -c to specify
the community string…

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:43.866
…-v to specify the SNMP version number…

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:46.600
…and -t 10

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.766
to increase the timeout
period to 10 seconds.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:59.966
Enumerating Windows Users

00:01:02.527 --> 00:01:06.200
This example enumerates
the users on a Windows system.

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:15.666
Enumerating Running Windows Processes

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.533
We can also enumerate
the running Windows processes.

00:01:28.137 --> 00:01:31.100
Enumerating Open TCP Ports

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:36.266
This example enumerates open TCP ports.

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:47.066
Enumerating Installed Software

00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:53.566
Lastly, we can enumerate
installed software as follows.
