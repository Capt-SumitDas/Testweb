Email Harvesting

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:08.133
Let’s begin our user information gathering
with some basic email harvesting.


00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:15.166
In this case, we will use theHarvester,
which gathers emails, names, subdomains,

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:20.033
IPs, and URLs from multiple public data
sources.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.233
We can run theHarvester with -d to specify
the target domain,

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.733
and -b to set the data source to search.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.366
We found some email addresses,

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:40.666
one of which appears to be new to us.

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:46.066
We have also found some new subdomains of
megacorpone.com.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.833
This is a good reminder that information
gathering is not always a neat,

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.400
linear process.

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:57.666
We may be looking for information on users
and find something else about our target.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:03.066
This is one reason it’s important to keep
good notes.
