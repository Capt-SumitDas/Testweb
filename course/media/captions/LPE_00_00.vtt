Locating Public Exploits

00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:08.697
In this module, we’ll focus on
various online resources

00:00:08.697 --> 00:00:12.563
that host exploits for publicly
known vulnerabilities.

00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:16.563
We’ll also inspect offline
tools available in Kali

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:19.330
that contain locally-hosted exploits.
