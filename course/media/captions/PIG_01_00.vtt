Website Recon

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.233
If the client has a website,

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:10.466
we can gather basic information by simply
browsing the site.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.500
Small organizations may only have a single
website,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.200
while large organizations might have many,
including some that are not maintained.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:30.166
Let’s check out MegaCorp One’s website to
learn more about our target.

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:40.633
A quick review of their website reveals 
that they are a nanotech company.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.300
The about page reveals email addresses and
Twitter accounts of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.833
some of their employees.

00:00:55.833 --> 00:01:00.700
We could use these addresses in a social
media information gathering campaign.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.133
It’s also worth mentioning that the
company’s email address format follows

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:10.800
a pattern of 
“first initial + last name”.

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:16.400
However, the CEO’s email address simply
uses his first name.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:21.933
This indicates that founders or long-time
employees

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:25.633
have a different email format than newer
hires.

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:30.066
This information could be useful in a
later stage of the assessment.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.266
Corporate social media accounts, found on
the same page,

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.266
are also worth recording for further
research.
