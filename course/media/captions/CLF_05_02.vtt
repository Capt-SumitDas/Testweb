00:00:01.346 --> 00:00:02.079
diff

00:00:02.677 --> 00:00:06.543
The diff command is used to detect
differences between files,

00:00:06.543 --> 00:00:08.343
similar to the comm command.

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:14.043
However, diff is much more complex
and supports many output formats.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.277
Two of the most popular formats
include the context format

00:00:18.277 --> 00:00:20.177
and the unified format.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.877
To display results in context format,
use the -c option.

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:28.007
This output uses the “-” indicator 

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.141
to show that the line appears in
the first file,

00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:32.607
but not in the second.

00:00:32.874 --> 00:00:37.441
Conversely, the “+” indicator shows that
the line appears in the second file,

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.941
but not in the first.

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:42.713
Now let’s see what the unified
format returns.

00:00:46.074 --> 00:00:48.307
The most notable difference
between these formats

00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:53.438
is that the unified format does not
show lines that match between files,

00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:55.305
making the results shorter.

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.513
The indicators, however, have
identical meaning in both formats.
