00:00:01.694 --> 00:00:04.500
Post-Exploitation Enumeration

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.433
First, let’s gather some basic
information about the host

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:12.166
such as network configuration,

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:16.733
hostname,

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:20.066
OS version,

00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:23.633
and kernel information.

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:27.666
From this basic information gathering,

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.666
we learn that the host is named “Ajla”,

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.566
the IP address is 10.4.4.10,

00:00:36.413 --> 00:00:42.300
and the version of Linux is
Ubuntu 16.04 on a 4.4 kernel.

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.633
Having collected this basic information,

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:49.100
we can move on to
more specific enumeration.

00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:52.100
Since we know that the
target is running WordPress,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.766
we should be able to find database
credentials in the configuration file.

00:01:05.742 --> 00:01:07.600
In the WordPress config file,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.366
we confirm that the database
server is on a different host,

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:16.633
we also find the active
MariaDB credentials.

00:01:17.927 --> 00:01:21.733
To continue, we need to solidify
our foothold into the network

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.633
and create a stable pivot point.
