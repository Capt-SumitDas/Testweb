00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.433
Bypassing Antivirus Detection


00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:10.900
Generally speaking, antivirus evasion
falls into two broad categories:

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.366
on-disk and in-memory.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:21.500
On-disk evasion focusses on modifying
malicious files physically stored on disk

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.000
in an attempt to evade AV detection.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.433
Given the maturity of AV file scanning,

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:33.566
modern malware often attempts in-memory
operation, avoiding the disk entirely.
