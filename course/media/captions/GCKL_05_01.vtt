00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.800
SSH Service

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.500
The Secure SHell service is most commonly 
used to remotely access a computer, 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
using a secure, encrypted protocol. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.166
The SSH service is TCP-based and 
listens by default on port 22.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:21.500
To start the SSH service, run systemCTL 
with the start option

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.166
followed by the service name, 
in this case, ssh.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.766
When the command completes successfully, 
it does not return any output

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:35.666
but we can verify that the SSH service is 
running and listening on TCP port 22

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:38.133
by issuing the ss command 

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:43.766
and piping the output into grep to 
search the output for “sshd”.

00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:47.733
To start the SSH service automatically 
at boot time 

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.300
(after changing the default Kali 
password),  

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.333
we pass systemCTL the enable 
parameter.

00:00:55.514 --> 00:01:01.733
We can use systemCTL to enable and 
disable most services within Kali Linux.
