00:00:01.336 --> 00:00:04.033
Exploiting Web-based Vulnerabilities

00:00:04.923 --> 00:00:06.666
Now that we’ve covered enumeration

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.500
and understand how to use
some of the basic tools,

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:13.500
we will turn our attention to
vulnerability exploitation.

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.300
In this section, we’ll discuss web-based
administration consoles

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.133
and focus on specific vulnerabilities

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:25.066
such as cross-site scripting,
directory traversal,

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:29.200
file inclusion, SQL injection, and more.
