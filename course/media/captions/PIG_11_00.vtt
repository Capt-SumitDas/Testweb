User Information Gathering

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:08.933
In addition to gathering information about
our target organization’s resources,

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:13.466
we can also gather information about the
organization’s employees.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.233
Our purpose for gathering this information
is to compile user or password lists,

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:23.400
build pretexting for social engineering,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.100
augment phishing campaigns or client-side
attacks,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.100
execute credential stuffing, and much
more.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.466
Some of the following methods will overlap
with those already discussed in previous

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:41.933
sections, but we’ll go deeper into a few
tools specific to user enumeration.
