Web Application Assessment Tools

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.433
Once we have thoroughly explored
a web application manually,

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:12.200
we should consider using
web application assessment tools

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.433
to enumerate more information
about the target.

00:00:15.672 --> 00:00:18.466
There are a variety of tools
that can aid in discovering

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.533
and exploiting
web application vulnerabilities,

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.866
many of which come pre-installed in Kali.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.800
In this section, we will
explore some of these tools

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.933
and in a later section,

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:33.033
we will shift our focus to manual
vulnerability enumeration

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.566
and exploitation.
