00:00:01.383 --> 00:00:03.866
File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:09.100
Unlike directory traversals that
simply display the contents of a file,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.333
File inclusion vulnerabilities allow
an attacker to include a file

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.133
into the application’s running code.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.133
In order to actually exploit a
file inclusion vulnerability,

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:24.273
we must be able to not
only execute code,

00:00:24.273 --> 00:00:28.266
but must also be able to write
our shell payload somewhere.

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:30.666
Local file inclusions occur

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:34.566
when the included file is loaded
from the same web server.

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:40.166
Remote file inclusions occur when a
file is loaded from an external source.

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:44.466
These vulnerabilities are commonly
found in PHP applications

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.666
but they can occur in other
programming languages as well.

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:50.066
The exploitation of these vulnerabilities

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.833
depends on the programming language
the application is written in

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:56.300
and the server configuration.

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.433
In the case of PHP,

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.866
the version of the language runtime

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.066
and web server configurations,

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:06.600
specifically php.ini values

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.966
such as register_globals
and allow_url wrappers,

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:15.366
make a considerable difference in how
these vulnerabilities can be exploited.

00:01:16.372 --> 00:01:22.366
Note that directory traversal vulnerabilities
are often used in conjunction with LFI’s,

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:27.266
specifically to specify the file
used in the LFI payload.
