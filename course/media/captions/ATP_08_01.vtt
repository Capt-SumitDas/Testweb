00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:03.533
Application Enumeration

00:00:04.194 --> 00:00:07.728
First, we can begin our
enumeration by looking at the

00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:13.333
Document-Object Model (DOM)
of the Jenkins login page.

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:19.966
To view the DOM, we right-click anywhere
on the page and select Inspect Element.

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:24.800
With the Firefox Web
Developer Tools open,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.966
we right-click on the top HTML
tag and select Expand All.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.266
A review of the DOM does not
reveal any new information.

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:41.633
We can see that the page
is a basic HTML form.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:47.600
Next, we will take a look at the source
code to see if it reveals anything new.

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:57.766
While Javascript can alter the DOM,
resulting in differing DOM and source,

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.484
this does not seem to be the case here.

00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:04.000
The source and DOM are fairly similar.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:15.633
Next, we will run a basic dirb scan
to discover any potential hidden files.

00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:22.033
Jenkins will respond with a 403 for any
file that we try to access when we are not

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:26.133
logged in, so we will run
our scan with the -w flag

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:29.700
to continue scanning past
the warning messages.

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:39.033
Our scan found some endpoints,
but nothing of value.

00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:44.600
Next, let’s do something that
our hacker intuition

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:47.433
has been whispering for us to try.

00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:56.633
Let’s try the credentials
admin:password and admin:admin.

00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:03.200
Weak password configurations are very
common within internal networks

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.000
as only “trusted” users are expected
to be able to access the server.

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:12.800
In addition, attempting a couple
of password combinations

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.200
will very rarely set off any alarms as
it’s typical for a regular user

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.633
to occasionally type in a
password incorrectly.

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:28.066
The credentials admin:password failed.

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:31.733
Next, we’ll try admin:admin.

00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:38.500
The admin:admin credentials worked!

00:02:38.813 --> 00:02:43.866
Next, we need to find a way to
exploit Jenkins to obtain a shell.
