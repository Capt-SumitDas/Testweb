00:00:01.472 --> 00:00:02.200
cut

00:00:02.847 --> 00:00:07.247
The cut command is simple, but often
comes in quite handy.

00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:10.998
Cut is used to extract a section
of text from a line

00:00:10.998 --> 00:00:13.374
and output it to standard output.

00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:17.239
Some of the most commonly-used
switches include -f

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.405
for the field number we are cutting

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:22.972
and -d to define the field delimiter.

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:25.089
Here,

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:29.088
we echoed a line of text and piped it
to the cut command

00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:31.489
to extract the second field

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.989
using a comma as the field delimiter.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:38.472
The same command can be used to
cut lines found in text files.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:42.672
This time, a list of users is
extracted from etc/passwd

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:47.205
by using a colon as a delimiter and
retrieving the first field.
