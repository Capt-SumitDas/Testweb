NTLM Authentication

00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:08.833
NTLM authentication is used when
a client authenticates to a server

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:12.633
by IP address instead of by hostname,

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:16.633
or if the user attempts to
authenticate to a hostname

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:21.633
that is not registered on the Active
Directory integrated DNS server.

00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:26.800
Third-party applications may also
choose to use NTLM authentication.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:32.800
The NTLM authentication
protocol consists of seven steps.

00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:37.733
In the first authentication step, the
computer calculates a cryptographic hash,

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.166
called the NTLM hash,

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:41.966
from the userâ€™s password.

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:46.466
Next, the client computer sends
the user name to the server,

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:49.066
which returns a random value

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.033
called the nonce or challenge.

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:56.233
The client then encrypts the
nonce using the NTLM hash,

00:00:56.233 --> 00:01:00.433
now known as a response,
and sends it to the server.

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:05.233
The server forwards the response
along with the username and the nonce

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:06.833
to the domain controller.

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:10.966
The validation is then performed
by the domain controller,

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:15.133
since it already knows the
NTLM hash of all users.

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:18.896
The domain controller encrypts
the challenge itself

00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:23.500
with the NTLM hash of the supplied
username and compares it

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.966
to the response it received
from the server.

00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:31.000
If the two are equal, the
authentication request is successful.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.500
Next we will turn to Kerberos which is
the default authentication protocol

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.966
for Active Directory and
associated services.
