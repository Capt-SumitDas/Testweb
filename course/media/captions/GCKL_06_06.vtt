00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
dpkg

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.132
dpkg is the core tool used to install a 
package, 

00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:11.733
either directly or indirectly through APT.

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:15.533
It is also the preferred tool to use when 
operating offline, 

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.633
since it does not require an Internet 
connection.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:22.633
Note that dpkg will not install any 
dependencies 

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.633
that the package might require.

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:30.466
To install a package, provide the -i 
option and the path to the package file.
