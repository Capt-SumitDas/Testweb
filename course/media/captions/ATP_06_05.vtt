00:00:01.493 --> 00:00:04.133
Post-Exploitation Enumeration

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:08.470
With access to the admin user,
we’ll begin enumeration in

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.866
search of the domain tokens
of any logged in users.

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:22.566
We don’t expect to find much
since we just restarted Windows,

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.133
but it’s a good idea to check anyway.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:30.500
To list the tokens, we will use
meterpreter’s incognito extension,

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:36.000
and list the tokens by the username.

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:43.866
Unfortunately, this does not provide us
with any access that we don’t already have

00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:48.333
We’ll look around a bit more.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:53.133
Thunderbird is installed, but is
not set up for the admin user.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.666
Still, we’ll check Alex’s mailbox by
navigating to their mail directory.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.833
These emails mention an
outdated version of Windows.

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:12.524
Since we didn’t find any other interesting
information, we will move on to scanning

00:01:12.524 --> 00:01:17.633
the entirety of the internal network to
see if we can find anything new.
