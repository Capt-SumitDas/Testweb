00:00:01.312 --> 00:00:04.845
Social Engineering and Client-Side Attacks

00:00:06.154 --> 00:00:10.954
As most client-side attacks require
some form of interaction with the target,

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:17.854
such as requiring the target to click on
a link, open an email, run an attachment,

00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:22.887
or open a document, we should
preemptively leverage social engineering

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.966
tactics to improve our
chances of success.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.545
Imagine the following scenario.

00:00:28.937 --> 00:00:32.204
We are on an engagement, trying
to execute a client-side attack

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:34.691
against the Human Resources department.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:39.991
We could just blindly jump in and attack,
but our chances of success are slim

00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:45.191
since we have no idea which operating
system and applications they are using,

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:47.025
nor which versions.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.354
Instead, we will favor caution
and respond to a job posting

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:57.987
with a malformed “resume” document
that is designed to not open.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:02.025
The next day, we receive an
email response indicating that,

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:06.425
not surprisingly, HR can
not open our document.

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:10.741
In an attempt to help resolve
the issue, we respond,

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:14.754
asking what exact version of
Microsoft Office they are using,

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:19.733
suggesting that the issue may be
caused by a version incompatibility.

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:24.000
In our scenario, we discover that
the HR representative is

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.020
unsurprisingly using a specific
version of Microsoft Office

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:31.433
and that they are allowed
to execute Word macros.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.583
Armed with this information, we can
craft a second resume Word document

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:39.762
containing a macro leveraging PowerShell

00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:43.341
to open a reverse shell
and email it to them.

00:01:50.487 --> 00:01:53.554
Of course, this is a
simplified success story.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:58.812
Your social engineering pretexts will
most certainly have to be more intricate

00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:03.912
and specific, based on information
you have gathered in advance.
