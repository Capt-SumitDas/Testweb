00:00:01.422 --> 00:00:04.133
Authenticated Scanning With Nessus

00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:09.766
We can generate more detailed
information and reduce false positives

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:15.933
by performing an authenticated scan,
which requires valid target credentials.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.497
To demonstrate the value
of an authenticated scan,

00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:22.400
we will run one against
our Debian lab client.

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:25.400
To begin,
we’ll click the “New Scan” button.

00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:29.733
Even though all Nessus templates accept user credentials,

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:33.300
we will use the Credentialed Patch Audit
scan template,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.333
which comes preconfigured

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.700
to execute local security
checks against the target.

00:00:39.313 --> 00:00:43.366
This template will not only scan for
missing operating system level patches,

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.733
but will also scan
for outdated applications

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.166
that could be vulnerable to vectors

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.033
such as privilege escalation.

00:00:56.686 --> 00:01:01.500
Once again, we will provide a name
for the scan and set the target.

00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:11.600
Note that the IP of your
Debian client will vary.

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:15.466
Next, we’ll click the “Credentials” tab,

00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:19.766
and the SSH category.

00:01:22.184 --> 00:01:26.866
On the “Authentication method”
dropdown, we’ll select “password”,

00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:31.500
set the username to “root”,

00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:38.333
and provide the password
for our Debian client.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.100
While we will only use the SSH
configuration for this example,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.900
we can easily review the other
Nessus-supported authentication mechanisms

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.100
by selecting “All” from the
“Categories” dropdown menu.

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:00.966
Finally, we can launch our scan.

00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:14.300
As with the unauthenticated scan,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300
while the scan is in progress

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.900
the status is reported as “Running”.

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:26.066
Once the scan reaches
a “Completed” status,

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:29.700
we can click on the scan name
to open up the list of hosts,

00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:34.866
and click on the Debian client’s IP.

00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:40.100
This shows a list of the
discovered vulnerabilities

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.366
that may be exploitable
on the Debian target.

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:47.153
In this view, notice that the
vulnerabilities are listed with

00:02:47.153 --> 00:02:48.366
patch numbers.

00:02:50.784 --> 00:02:53.700
This is because Nessus determined
that the target was running

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.900
the Debian operating system

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.500
and executed only the
Debian Local Security Checks plugins.

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:07.200
We can see that the authenticated
scan was successful

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.700
as the scanner now has visibility

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.933
into vulnerable applications

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:14.266
that are not remotely exposed,

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:16.133
such as Firefox.
