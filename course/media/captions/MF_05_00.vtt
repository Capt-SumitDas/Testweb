00:00:01.852 --> 00:00:04.852
Post-Exploitation with Metasploit

00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:09.200
Once we gain access to a target machine,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.867
we can move on to the post-exploitation
phase where we gather information,

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:20.966
take steps to maintain our access, or
pivot to other machines in the network.

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:26.633
The Metasploit Framework has several
interesting features and modules

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:32.166
that can simplify many aspects
of the post-exploitation process.

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:37.866
In addition to the built-in Meterpreter
commands, a number of post-exploitation

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:42.633
MSF modules have been written
that leverage an active session.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.366
Letâ€™s take a closer look at some of
these post-exploitation features.
