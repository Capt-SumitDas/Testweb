Passive Information Gathering


00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.033
Passive Information Gathering

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:11.133
(also known as Open-source Intelligence or
OSINT),

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:16.166
is the process of collecting openly
available information about a target,

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:20.666
generally without any direct interaction
with that target.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:26.366
There are a variety of resources and tools
we can use to gather this information

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.900
and the process is cyclical rather than
linear.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:34.166
In other words, the “next step” of any
stage of the process

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:38.133
depends on what we find during the
previous steps,

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.066
creating “cycles” of processes.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:45.766
The ultimate goal of passive information
gathering is to obtain information

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:50.033
that clarifies or expands an attack
surface,

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.966
helps us conduct a successful phishing
campaign,

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:58.800
or supplements other penetration testing
steps such as password guessing.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.100
Before we begin, we need to define passive
information gathering.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.400
There are two different schools of
thought on what constitutes

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.433
“passive” in this context.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:14.700
In the strictest interpretation, we never
communicate with the target directly.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:18.433
For example, we could rely on third
parties for information,

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:23.066
but we wouldn’t access any of the target’s
systems or servers.

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:27.233
In a looser interpretation, we might
interact with the target,

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.300
but only as a normal Internet user would.

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:35.000
For example, if the target’s website
allows us to register for an account,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.300
we could do that.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.733
However, under this interpretation

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:43.066
we would not test the website for
vulnerabilities during this phase.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:46.233
In this module, we will adopt this latter,

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:50.066
less rigid interpretation for our
approach.
