Linux Buffer Overflows

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:08.066
In this module, we will introduce Linux
buffer overflows by exploiting Crossfire,

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.400
a Linux-based role playing game.

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:16.400
Specifically, Crossfire 1.9.0 is
vulnerable to a network-based buffer

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.466
overflow when passing a string of more
than 4000 bytes to the

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.700
“setup sound” command.

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:26.400
In order to debug the application,
we’ll use the Evans Debugger,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.400
which provides us with a familiar-looking
debugging enviroment.
