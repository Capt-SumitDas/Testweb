00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.900
Stack Overflow

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.033
Stack Overflow is a website for developers
to ask and answer

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:11.400
coding related questions.

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.466
The site’s value from an information
gathering perspective

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:27.066
is in looking at the types of questions a
given user is asking or answering.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:33.833
If we can reasonably determine a user on
Stack Overflow is also an employee of our

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:39.866
target organization, we may be able to
infer some things about the organization

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:43.633
based on the employee’s questions and
answers.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.133
For example, if we found a user that is
always asking and answering questions

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:54.400
about Python, it would be reasonable to
assume they use that programming language

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.800
on a daily basis, and it would likely be
used at the organization

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.433
where they are employed.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.233
Even worse, if we find employess
discussing sensitive information

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:09.066
such as vulnerability remediation on
these types of forums,

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:13.733
we could discover unpatched
vulnerablities during this phase.
