00:00:01.654 --> 00:00:04.300
Post-Exploitation Enumeration

00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:07.200
Now that we have a shell on Zora,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.866
let’s collect some general information
about the host to see what we can learn.

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:17.166
Let’s start by checking the
flavor of Linux that is running.

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:24.866
Alpine Linux is a security-oriented
Linux distribution

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:28.566
based on mussel libc and busybox.

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:31.966
This is useful information
and reveals that the server

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:36.700
will likely not have very many
services or applications running.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.366
Anything out of the ordinary
might be a good target

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.233
so let’s continue to collect information.

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:52.233
The proc version file tells us that the
distro was built in October of 2019.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:56.833
Other than that, we can take note of
the kernel version and move forward.

00:00:57.684 --> 00:01:00.400
Let’s have a look at the
environment variables.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.833
Unfortunately, the environment
variables don’t tell us much.

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:11.748
Looking at the running processes
also does not reveal

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:14.300
any useful information on
what we could exploit.

00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:18.662
Let’s run netstat to see if we
have access to any new ports

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:22.500
not exposed from the
sandbox external network.

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:29.833
Unfortunately the open ports don’t provide
us with any new information either.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.133
Let’s check the filesystem.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.666
The contents of /etc/fstab
are interesting.

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:43.700
A share is mounted from
the 10.5.5.20 host.

00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:48.566
Let’s poke around the scripts
share and see what we can find.

00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:59.838
We seem to have discovered a set of
credentials in the system report file

00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:02.133
for a user named alex.

00:02:02.937 --> 00:02:06.033
We also seem to have found
the name of the target

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:08.533
where the share is
mounted, “Poultry”.

00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:12.266
Looking at the type of
scripts in this directory

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:17.333
and taking into account that the user
seems to be a part of the “sandbox” domain

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.600
we might be looking at
a Windows computer.
