00:00:01.911 --> 00:00:03.066
Wrapping Up

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:10.300
The Metasploit Framework is valuable in
almost every phase of a penetration test,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.066
including passive and active
information gathering,

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:18.633
vulnerability research and
development, client-side attacks,

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:22.133
post-exploitation, and much more.

00:00:25.956 --> 00:00:28.829
In this module, we walked
through some of the primary

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.100
features of the Metasploit Framework.

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:36.233
However, with such an overwhelming
number of modules and features,

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:37.966
itâ€™s easy to get lost.

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.406
To help solidify these techniques,
we strongly recommend

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:44.833
that you thoroughly complete
the exercises in this module

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:51.900
 and refer to the free Offensive Security
online course, Metasploit Unleashed,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.166
for much more in-depth
training and information.
