00:00:01.587 --> 00:00:05.066
Core Post-Exploitation Features

00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:09.366
As we have seen earlier, we can
navigate the file system

00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.366
and list OS and user information

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:16.366
 along with running processes
on the compromised host.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.142
We can also both upload
and download files directly 

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:22.366
from the Meterpreter command prompt.

00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:28.300
More basic post-exploiatation features
are available from meterpreter,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.466
including the screenshot command which
captures images of the compromised desktop

00:00:57.037 --> 00:00:59.966
Meterpreter also allows
us to start a keylogger

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:05.200
and detect active user
keystrokes with keyscan start.

00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:10.250
It is important to realize
that all features execute

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.600
in the context of the
current meterpreter session.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:29.566
In our scenario, when we exploited
SyncBreeze, we obtained a reverse shell

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:34.733
running in the context of
the NT SYSTEM user.

00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:40.333
Because this is a non-interactive user,

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:44.066
the keyscan dump won’t
generate any results.

00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:50.984
In order to capture keystrokes
from a regular user,

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:53.800
we will have to migrate
our shell process

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.566
to the user context 
we are targeting.

00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:02.533
Let’s discuss the process
of changing context.
