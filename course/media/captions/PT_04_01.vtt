Wireshark Basics

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:06.067
While analyzing network
traffic with a sniffer,

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:10.267
it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the
amount of “noise” in the collected data.

00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:12.549
In order to facilitate the analysis,

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.049
we can apply capture filters
and display filters within Wireshark.

00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:20.853
The secret to using any network
sniffer, including Wireshark,

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:25.819
is learning how to use capture and display
filters to strip out superfluous data.

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:29.058
Fortunately, Wireshark’s
graphical interface

00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:34.139
makes it relatively easy to visualize data
and work with the various filters.
