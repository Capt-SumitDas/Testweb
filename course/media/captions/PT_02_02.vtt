Socat Reverse Shells

00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.766
Let’s take a look at a reverse
shell using socat.

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:13.566
First, Bob will start a listener
on port 443.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:18.595
This is a standard listener
with the addition of -d -d

00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:21.538
which increases the verbosity
of the output.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.166
Next, Alice will use socat’s
EXEC option,

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:32.733
which is similar to the
Netcat -e equivalent.

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:37.604
In this case, Alice will use the
EXEC:/bin/bash option

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.076
to send a reverse shell to
Bob’s listening socket.

00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.471
Once connected, Bob can enter
commands from his socat session

00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:51.238
which will execute on Alice’s machine.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.533
This is a great start, and we have
covered some important topics,

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:03.195
but so far all of our socat network
activity has been in the clear.

00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:11.242
Next, we’ll take a look at the
basics of encryption with socat.
