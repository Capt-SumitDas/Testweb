Redirecting from a File

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:08.961
As you may have guessed, we can use the
left-angle bracket operator

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:11.361
to send data the “other way”.

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:16.495
In this example, we’ll redirect the wc
command’s Standard Input

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:21.461
with data originating from the file we
generated in the previous section.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.461
Let’s try this with wc -m,

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:27.195
which counts characters in the file.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.177
Note that this effectively “connected”
the contents of our file

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.961
to the standard input of the
wc -m command.
