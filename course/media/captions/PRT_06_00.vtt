Wrapping Up

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:09.100
In this module, we covered the concepts
of port forwarding and tunneling.

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:18.400
The module contains tools to apply these
techniques on both Windows

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.366
and UNIX-based operating systems,
which allow us to bypass various firewall

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:29.366
as well as deep packet inspection devices.
