00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.633
Finding Files in Kali Linux

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:08.733
Three of the most common commands 
used to locate files in Kali Linux

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:12.133
include find, locate, and which. 

00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:17.400
These utilities have similarities, but 
work and return data in different ways

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.866
and are useful in different circumstances.

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.633
which

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.933
The which command searches through 
directories defined in the

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:30.433
PATH environment variable for a 
given file name.

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:34.133
This variable contains a listing of 
directories that Kali searches 

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.800
when a command is issued 
without its path.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.466
If a match is found, “which” returns 
the full path to the file.

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:46.062
locate

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:49.666
The locate command is the quickest way to 
find the location of files 

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.433
and directories within the filesystem.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:57.500
In order to provide a much shorter search 
time, locate searches a built-in database 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.266
named locate.db rather than the entire 
hard disk itself.

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:07.366
This database is automatically updated 
on a regular basis by the cron scheduler

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:11.400
but it can also be updated manually 
with the updatedb command.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.466
To search for a given file, pass its 
name to locate.

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:21.433
find

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:26.233
The find command is the most complex and 
flexible search tool among the three.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:29.333
Mastering its syntax can sometimes 
be tricky, 

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:33.033
but its capabilities go well beyond 
a normal file search.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:36.333
As a basic example, let’s perform a 
recursive search 

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:39.300
starting from the root file system 
directory 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.500
and look for any file that starts 
with the letters “sbd”.

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:49.533
The main advantage of find over locate 
is that it can search for files 

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:52.100
and directories by more than just 
the name.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.366
With find, we can search by file age, 
size, owner, file type, 

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:02.066
timestamp, permissions, and more.
