00:00:01.137 --> 00:00:04.570
Metasploit User Interfaces and Setup

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:09.520
Although the Metasploit Framework
is preinstalled in Kali Linux,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.287
the postgresql service that 
Metasploit depends on 

00:00:13.287 --> 00:00:17.020
is neither active nor
enabled at boot time.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.400
We can start the required service as we
would any other common service:

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.866
We can also enable the service
at boot with systemctl.

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:43.179
With the database started, we
need to create and initialize

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:48.741
the metasploit framework
database with msfdb init.

00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:56.583
Since Metasploit is under
constant development,

00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:59.283
we should update it as
often as possible.

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:03.741
Within Kali, we can update
Metasploit with apt.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:15.029
We can launch the Metasploit command-
line interface with “msfconsole.”
