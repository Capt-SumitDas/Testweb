00:00:01.185 --> 00:00:02.933
SNMP Enumeration

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:08.000
Over the years, we have often found that
the Simple Network Management Protocol

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.933
is not well-understood by
many network administrators.

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:16.433
This often results in
SNMP misconfigurations,

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.833
which can result in significant
information leakage.

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:22.933
SNMP is based on UDP,

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.433
a simple, stateless protocol,

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:29.866
and is therefore susceptible to
IP spoofing and replay attacks.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:36.115
In addition, the commonly used
SNMP protocols 1, 2, and 2c

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:38.466
offer no traffic encryption,

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:42.300
meaning that SNMP information
and credentials

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.766
can be easily intercepted
over a local network.

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:51.100
Traditional SNMP protocols also
have weak authentication schemes

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.166
and are commonly left configured

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:57.033
with default public and
private community strings.

00:00:57.873 --> 00:01:01.666
Now, consider that all of
the above applies to a protocol,

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:05.433
which by definition is meant to
“Manage the Network”.

00:01:06.618 --> 00:01:11.866
For all these reasons, SNMP is another one
of our favorite enumeration protocols.
