00:00:01.571 --> 00:00:03.200
Automated Enumeration

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:07.066
Each operating system contains
a wealth of information

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.233
that can be used for further attacks.

00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:12.700
However, collecting this detailed
information manually

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.666
can take a lot of time.

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:19.633
Fortunately, we can use various
scripts to automate this process.

00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:25.766
On Windows, one such script is
windows-privesc-check.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.300
Running the executable with the -h
flag displays the help menu.

00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:35.600
This tool accepts many options.

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.900
Let’s list information about the
user groups on the system.

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:43.566
We’ll use the –dump option to view output,

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:46.933
and -G to list groups.

00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:52.900
The script successfully executes
and provides us with

00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:55.900
information about the
groups on the system.

00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:04.340
Similar to windows-privesc-check
on Windows targets,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.066
we can also use unix_privesc_check
on UNIX derivatives such as Linux.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.933
We can view the tool help by running
the script without any arguments.

00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:22.400
According to the help menu, the script
supports “standard” and “detailed” mode.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.800
The standard mode appears to
perform a speed-optimized process.

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:36.000
We will use the standard mode and redirect
the output to a file called output.txt.

00:01:37.157 --> 00:01:41.900
The script performs numerous checks for
permissions on common files.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:46.238
For example, the following section
reveals configuration files

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:49.066
that are writable by non-root users:

00:01:51.112 --> 00:01:56.500
This shows that anyone on the system
can edit the /etc/passwd file!

00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:03.866
This is quite serious because it allows
attackers to easily elevate their privileges

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.800
or create user accounts on the target.

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:13.366
Although these tools perform
many automated checks,

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:16.800
keep in mind that every
system is different,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.666
and some system changes will often be
missed by these types of tools.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.833
For this reason, it’s important to
watch out for unique configurations

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:30.100
which can only be caught
by manual inspection.
