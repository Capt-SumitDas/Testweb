Wordlists

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.466
Wordlists, sometimes referred to as 
dictionary files, are simply text files

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:15.933
containing words for use as input to 
programs designed to test passwords.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:19.266
Precision is generally more important 
than coverage 

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.633
when considering a dictionary attack, 

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:27.200
meaning it’s more important to create a 
lean wordlist of relevant passwords 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.566
than it is to create an enormous, 
generic wordlist.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:36.000
Because of this, many wordlists are 
based on a common theme, 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.666
such as popular culture references, 


00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:42.700
specific industries, or geographic 
regions.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.700
Kali Linux includes a number of 
these dictionary files 

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:52.833
in the /usr/share/wordlists directory 
and many more are hosted online.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.666
When conducting a password attack, it may 
be tempting 

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.200
to simply use these pre-built lists.

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.833
However, we can be much more effective 
in our approach 

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:08.066
if we take the time to carefully build 
our own custom lists.

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:13.933
In this section, we’ll examine tools and 
approaches to create effective wordlists.
