00:00:01.492 --> 00:00:04.333
Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities

00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:11.500
Directory traversal vulnerabilities, also
known as path traversal vulnerabilities,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.733
allow attackers to gain
unauthorized access to files

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:22.066
within an application or files normall
 not accessible through a web interface,

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:26.666
such as those outside the
applicationâ€™s web root directory.

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:30.966
This vulnerability occurs
when input is poorly validated,

00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:35.566
subsequently granting an attacker
the ability to manipulate file paths.

00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:38.833
These attacks can
expose sensitive information

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:42.833
but they do not execute
code on the application server.

00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:47.466
On certain application servers written
in specific programming languages,

00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:53.666
directory traversal attacks can be used to
help facilitate file inclusion attacks.

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:56.300
While there is some
overlap in the techniques

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.133
used to identify these
two types of vulnerabilities,

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.633
they are distinct in their outcomes.

00:01:02.193 --> 00:01:05.100
We will cover directory
traversal techniques first

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.833
and file inclusion vulnerabilities
in a later section.
