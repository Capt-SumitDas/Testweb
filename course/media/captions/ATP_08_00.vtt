00:00:00.851 --> 00:00:03.433
Targeting the Jenkins Server

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:07.934
Jenkins is an automation server
that can be used to automate

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:11.700
a number of tasks related
to software development.

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:16.833
Because of their nature, tools like
Jenkins can generally execute code.

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:21.733
This is necessary in order to
set up custom repeatable tasks

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:25.366
triggered by specific events or actions.

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:29.300
As always, we want to conduct
some level of enumeration

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.033
before we begin trying
to exploit anything.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.500
Weâ€™ve already conducted some network
enumeration through a port scan,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.633
but now we want to concentrate
solely on the Jenkins web application.
