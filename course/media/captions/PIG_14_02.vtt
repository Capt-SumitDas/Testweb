Maltego

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:07.866
Maltego is a very powerful data mining
tool

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:12.733
that offers an endless combination of
search tools and strategies.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.466
Maltego's learning curve can be steep,

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.633
and it is frankly overkill for this
module,

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:29.766
but its impressive capability warrants
an introduction.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.300
Maltego searches thousands of online data
sources, and uses extremely clever

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.233
“transforms” to convert one piece of
information into another.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:51.333
For example, if we are performing a user
information gathering campaign,

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:56.100
we could submit an email address, and
through various automated searches,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.000
“transform” that into an associated phone
number or street address.

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:06.466
During an organizational information
gathering exercise,

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:12.433
we could submit a domain name and
“transform” that into a web server,

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:18.066
then a list of email addresses, then a
list of associated social media accounts,

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:22.966
and then into a potential password list
for that email account.

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:28.400
The combinations are endless, and
the discovered information is presented

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.400
in a scaleable graph that allows easy
zoom-and-pan navigation.

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:39.766
