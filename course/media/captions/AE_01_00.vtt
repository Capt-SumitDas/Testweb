00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.100
What is Antivirus Software

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:09.866
Antivirus is a type of application
designed to prevent, detect, and remove

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.400
malicious software.

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.566
It was originally designed to simply 
remove computer viruses.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.066
However, with the development of other 
types of malware,

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:23.433
antivirus software now typically includes 
additional protections

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.966
such as firewalls, website scanners, 
and more.
