00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:04.391
Persistent Bash Customization

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:10.038
The behavior of interactive shells in
Bash is determined by the system-wide

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:17.204
bashrc file located in /etc/bash.bashrc.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:22.938
The system-wide Bash settings can be
overridden by editing the .bashrc file

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:25.804
located in any user’s home directory.

00:00:26.404 --> 00:00:29.771
In the previous section, we explored
the alias command,

00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:33.204
which sets an alias for the
current terminal session.

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:37.238
We can also insert this command
into the .bashrc file

00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:41.304
in a user’s home directory to set
a persistent alias.

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:45.764
The .bashrc script is executed
any time that user logs in.

00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:49.164
Since this file is a shell script, we can
insert any command

00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:52.298
that could be executed from
the command prompt.

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:56.044
Let’s examine a few lines of
our default .bashrc file.

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:03.591
You might recognize the HISTSIZE and
HISTFILESIZE environment variables…

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:09.598
and the alias command that
displays colored output.

00:01:09.598 --> 00:01:13.598
You will also find some other aliases
in this file that are commented out.
