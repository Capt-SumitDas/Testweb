00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.400
Meterpreter Payloads

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.033
As described on the Metasploit site,
Meterpreter is a multi-function payload

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:12.533
that can be dynamically
extended at run-time.

00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:16.045
In practice, this means
that the Meterpreter shell

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:20.412
provides more features and functionality
than a regular command shell,

00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:23.679
offering capabilities such
as file transfer, 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.512
keylogging, and various other methods
of interacting with the victim machine.

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:33.845
These tools are especially useful
in the post-exploitation phase.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.879
Because of Meterpreter’s
flexibility and capability,

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:42.558
it’s the favorite and most commonly-
used Metasploit payload.

00:00:45.808 --> 00:00:50.658
A search for the keyword “meterpreter”
returns a long list of results.

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:57.170
Narrowing the search to
the payload category

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.125
reveals meterpreter versions for multiple
operating systems and architectures

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:13.858
including Windows, Linux, Android, Apple
iOS, FreeBSD, and Apple OS X/macOS.

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:19.450
There are a multitude of Meterpreter
versions based on specific

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.962
programming languages,
protocols and transports,

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:25.729
and other various specifications.

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:32.225
We can select a specific
meterpreter payload with “set”

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:37.125
and configure it just as we would
a standard reverse shell payload:

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:46.725
Let’s try this payload against Syncbreeze.

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:52.925
With everything configured correctly,
we can launch the exploit

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:56.058
and establish a reverse
meterpreter connection:

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:09.700
Let’s dig a bit farther into Meterpreter
to demonstrate how it is more flexible

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:12.866
and powerful than standard payloads.
