axel

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:06.072
Axel is a download accelerator that
transfers a file from

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:10.430
an FTP or HTTP server through
multiple connections.

00:00:10.613 --> 00:00:12.847
This tool has a vast array of features,

00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:15.447
but the most common option is -n

00:00:15.447 --> 00:00:19.247
which is used to specify the
number of multiple connections to use.

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:24.555
We also like using the -a option for a
more concise progress indicator

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:29.088
and -o to specify a different file
name for the downloaded file.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.913
Axel speeds up downloads
extremely well

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:36.913
and is especially useful for
large downloads.
