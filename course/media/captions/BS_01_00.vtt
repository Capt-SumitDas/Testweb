00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.800
Intro to Bash Scripting


00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:08.066
A Bash script is a plain-text file that 
contains a series of commands that are 

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:11.066
executed as if they had been typed at a 
terminal prompt.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.900
Generally speaking, Bash scripts have an 
optional extension of .sh,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.600
begin with a bash shebang, 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.600
and must have executable permissions set
before they can be executed.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.600
Let’s begin with a simple “Hello World”
Bash script:


00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:33.533
This script has several components worth 
explaining:


00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.566
On line 1, the pound sign followed by an 
exclamation point 

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.033
is commonly known as a shebang

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:42.733
and is ignored by the Bash interpreter.

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.266
The second part, /bin/bash, 

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:49.200
is the absolute path to the interpreter

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.366
which is used to run the script.

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:55.466
This is what makes this a “Bash script” 
as opposed to another type

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:59.033
of shell script, like a “C Shell script”, 
for example.

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:03.000
On line 2, the pound sign is used to add
a comment, 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.666
so all text that follows it is ignored.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.966
Then on line 3, echo “Hello World!” 

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:13.600
uses the echo utility to print a string 
to the terminal,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.066
which in this case is “Hello World!”

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.300
Next, let’s make the script executable 
and run it.


00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:24.066
The chmod command, 

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:28.600
along with the +x option is used to make 
the script executable.

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:35.100
Now we can run the script with 
./hello-world.sh


00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.800
The ./ notation may seem confusing  but 
this is simply a path notation 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.866
indicating that this script is in the 
current directory.

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:48.900
Since our home directory is not included
in the PATH environment variable, 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.400
we must use the relative path to our Bash 
script

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.366
in order for Bash to “find it” and run it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.500
Now that we have created our first Bash 
script, 


00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500
let’s explore Bash in a bit more detail.
