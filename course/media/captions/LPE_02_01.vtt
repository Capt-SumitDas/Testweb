00:00:01.265 --> 00:00:03.465
Online Exploit Resources

00:00:04.565 --> 00:00:07.732
Various online resources
host exploit code

00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:10.932
and make it available to
the public for free.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:16.415
In this section, we’ll cover the three
most popular online resources.

00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:27.081
These sites usually conduct tests on
the submitted exploit code

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:31.081
and remove any that are
deemed fake or malicious.

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:34.731
The Exploit Database

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:41.231
The Exploit Database is a project
maintained by Offensive Security.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.999
It’s a free archive of public exploits
that are gathered through submissions,

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.799
mailing lists, and public resource.

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:58.515
The Exploit Database was
designed to allow users to

00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:01.348
quickly find the information
they’re looking for.

00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:11.215
We can easily filter by type,
platform, author, port, and tag.

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.433
In contrast to other online resources,

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.215
The Exploit Database occasionally
provides the installer

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:22.215
for the vulnerable version of the
software for research purposes.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:30.649
When the installer is available, it’s
marked with a download box icon

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.949
displayed in the “A” column.

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:37.582
Another useful feature of
the Exploit Database

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:41.649
is that it indicates which
exploits are known to be valid.

00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:48.549
These entries are indicated with a
checkmark in the “V” column.

00:01:50.548 --> 00:01:54.215
The filters for type,
platform, and author 

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:58.348
can also be applied by selecting
them in the table itself.

00:02:07.932 --> 00:02:10.698
To see all of the information
for a particular exploit,

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:13.665
we simply click the exploit title.

00:02:14.915 --> 00:02:17.148
On the individual exploit pages,

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:22.465
we can review all available metadata
and the content of the exploit itself.

00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:26.398
When we return back to the main page…

00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:28.782
…our filters are still applied.

00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:34.098
To return to the default data set,
we click the “Reset All” button.

00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:41.349
Exploit Database updates are announced
through the Twitter and RSS feeds.

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:47.649
SecurityFocus Exploit Archives

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:54.049
The SecurityFocus Exploit Archives
website was created in 1999

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.082
and focuses on some key areas
important to the security community.

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:03.065
These areas include the
BugTraq mailing list

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:06.415
and the SecurityFocus
vulnerability database.

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:12.682
SecurityFocus is a vulnerability database
as opposed to an exploit database

00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:17.282
so many of its entries do not 
include proof of concept code.

00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:30.898
However, each entry contains
external references.

00:03:31.682 --> 00:03:34.982
These references can provide
a great deal of information

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:39.782
regarding the vulnerability and
often include proof of concept code.

00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:43.565
SecurityFocus announces updates
through their Twitter feed,

00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:46.265
and an RSS feed is available as well.

00:03:49.414 --> 00:03:50.414
Packet Storm

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.565
Packet Storm was established in 1998.

00:03:54.897 --> 00:03:57.397
It provides up-to-date security news

00:03:57.397 --> 00:04:00.664
and as with the Exploit Database
and SecurityFocus,

00:04:00.664 --> 00:04:04.731
also posts information about
exploits and vulnerabilities.

00:04:07.798 --> 00:04:13.265
A key differentiator of Packet Storm is
that it also hosts security tools.

00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:18.597
These tools are often tailored to
a specific vulnerability or scenario

00:04:18.597 --> 00:04:20.431
and can be very useful.

00:04:20.997 --> 00:04:25.997
As with the other resources we’ve covered,
PacketStorm posts updates to Twitter

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:28.781
and also publishes an RSS feed.

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:38.881
Google Search Operators

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.249
In addition to the individual
websites that we’ve covered,

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.749
we can search for additional
exploit-hosting sites

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.249
using traditional search engines.

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:53.782
We can begin searching for a
specific software and version

00:04:53.782 --> 00:04:59.115
followed by the exploit keyword
and include various search operators

00:04:59.115 --> 00:05:03.549
(like those used by the Google
search engine) to narrow our search.

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:08.833
Mastering these advanced operators
can help us tailor our search results

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:11.366
to find exactly what we’re looking for.

00:05:13.065 --> 00:05:16.532
As an example, we can use
the following search query

00:05:16.532 --> 00:05:21.098
to locate vulnerabilities affecting
the Microsoft Edge browser

00:05:21.098 --> 00:05:25.198
and limit the results to only
those exploits that are hosted

00:05:25.198 --> 00:05:27.898
on the Exploit Database website.

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:38.699
Other search operators that can be used to
fine-tune our searches include “inurl”,

00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:42.632
“intext”,

00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:46.932
and “intitle”.

00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:54.715
With just a few iterative searches, we’re
able to rapidly narrow down our results. 

00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:03.015
As a gentle reminder,

00:06:03.015 --> 00:06:09.015
always use extreme caution when using
exploits from non-curated resources.
