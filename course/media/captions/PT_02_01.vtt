Socat File Transfers

00:00:04.426 --> 00:00:07.726
Continuing with the previous
fictional characters of Alice and Bob,

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:13.615
assume Alice needs to send Bob a 
file called secret_passwords.txt.

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:18.503
Let’s see this in action.

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:24.712
On Alice’s side, we’ll share
the file on port 443.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.924
Again, we use the TCP4-LISTEN option,

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:30.424
as well as fork

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:34.324
which creates a child process once
a connection is made to the listener.

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:40.236
Then we use the file option followed
by the name of the file to be transferred.

00:00:44.348 --> 00:00:48.615
On Bob’s side, we’ll connect to
Alice’s computer and retrieve the file.

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:53.469
Once again, we are using
the TCP4 protocol option

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.803
and have specified Alice’s IP
address and listening port number.

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:02.934
We have also included the file option
which specifies the local file name on

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:06.001
Bob’s computer where the
file will be saved.

00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:13.591
Great, our file was transferred correctly.
