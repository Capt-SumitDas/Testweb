00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:03.600
How Vulnerability Scanners Work

00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:07.400
Vulnerability scanner
implementations vary,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.733
but generally follow a standard workflow.

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:13.700
Most automated scanners will:

00:00:14.608 --> 00:00:16.866
Detect if a target is up and running.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:22.366
Conduct a full or partial port scan,
depending on the configuration.

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:27.566
Identify the operating system using
common fingerprinting techniques.

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:33.066
Attempt to identify running services with
common techniques such as banner grabbing,

00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:35.400
service behavior identification,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.166
or file discovery.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:42.800
And, execute a signature-matching process
to discover vulnerabilities.

00:00:44.742 --> 00:00:49.533
Notice that this process basically mirrors
what we do during a manual assessment.

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:51.533
As penetration testers,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:56.000
we may mentally execute some
type of signature-matching process.

00:00:56.953 --> 00:00:57.666
For example,

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:02.500
we may remember that a particular version
of an application we spot in the field

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.066
is vulnerable to a remote exploit.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.366
An automated scanner, however,

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:12.666
performs this step with the assistance
of unique vulnerability signatures.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.933
Most automated scanners inspect a wide
variety of target information

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.666
during the signature-matching process.

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:22.503
Nevertheless,

00:01:22.503 --> 00:01:27.466
even a strong signature match does not
guarantee the presence of a vulnerability.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.030
This means automated scanners can
generate quite a few false positives

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.466
and by contrast,

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.966
false negatives,

00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:40.866
in which a vulnerability is overlooked
because of a signature mismatch.

00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:45.833
However, by updating the signature
database before every engagement,

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:48.466
we ensure that our scanner has the best

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:51.800
chance of discovering
the latest vulnerabilities.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.166
This signature-matching process
is quite efficient,

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.400
and is much faster than
a fully manual review,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.900
making automated vulnerability scanners
an excellent choice as a first-pass

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.600
during an assessment and a perfect
companion to a manual review.

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:14.400
Although vulnerability scanners are
designed to be relatively easy to use,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.033
there are still some additional
considerations to keep in mind.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.800
Vulnerability scan results can vary based on the level of automation,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.433
whether a scan is conducted on a LAN

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:26.700
or over the Internet,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.966
and whether a scan is run with credentials or not.

00:02:31.677 --> 00:02:34.566
