Tcpdump

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:07.442
Tcpdump is a text-based
network sniffer

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:11.875
and is by far the most commonly-used
command-line packet analyzer.

00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:16.075
It can be found on most Unix
and Linux operating systems.

00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:22.427
Tcpdump can both capture traffic from the
network and read existing capture files.

00:00:23.727 --> 00:00:28.327
Let’s look at what happened in a .pcap
file, which was captured on a firewall.

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:34.979
First, we’ll launch tcpdump with
sudo and open the file with the -r option
