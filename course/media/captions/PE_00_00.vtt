00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.166
PowerShell Empire

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:08.600
Empire is a “PowerShell and Python
post-exploitation agent” 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.633
with a heavy focus on client-side
exploitation

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.633
and post-exploitation 

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.300
of Active Directory deployments.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:20.933
Exploitation and post-exploitation
are performed using PowerShell 

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:25.233
on Windows, and Python on Linux and macOS.

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.900
Empire relies on standard pre-installed 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.500
libraries and features.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000
PowerShell execution requires only 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.433
PowerShell version 2 and Linux and Mac
modules require Python 2.6 or 2.7.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.566
While Empire seems to share many features 
with the Metasploit Framework, 

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.733
they are quite different in nature.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:52.133
Metasploit has a vast collection of 
exploits geared towards gaining

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.666
initial access.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.766
On the other hand, Empire is designed as
a post-exploitation tool

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.700
targeted primarily at
Active Directory environments.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:07.900
Empire tends to leverage built-in features
of the target operating system

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.000
and its major applications.
