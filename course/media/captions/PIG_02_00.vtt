00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.400
Whois Enumeration

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:10.533
Whois is a TCP service, tool, and a type
of database that can provide information

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:15.466
about a domain name, such as the name
server and registrar.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:25.533
This information is often public since
registrars charge a fee

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.100
for private registration.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.266
We can gather basic information about a
domain name by executing a standard

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:38.800
forward search by passing the domain name
into the whois client.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:46.600
Not all of this data is useful, but we did
discover some valuable information.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.633
First, the output reveals that Alan
Grofield registered the domain name.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.933
According to the Megacorp One Contact
page,

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.800
Alan is the “IT and Security Director”.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:19.366
We also found the name servers for
MegaCorp One.

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:24.933
Name servers are a component of DNS, which
we won’t be examining here,

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:29.000
but we should add these servers to our
notes for further investigation.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.433
In addition to this standard forward
lookup, which gathers information

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:41.866
about a DNS name, the whois client can
also perform reverse lookups.

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:47.766
Assuming we have an IP address, we can
perform a reverse lookup to gather more

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.133
information about it.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.900
The results of the reverse lookup gives us
information on who is hosting the

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.500
IP address.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.933
This information could be useful later,
and as with all the information we gather,

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:08.200
we should add this to our notes.
