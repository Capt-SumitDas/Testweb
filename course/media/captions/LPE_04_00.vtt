00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.583
Wrapping Up

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:08.129
In this module, we discussed the risks
associated with running code

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.729
written by untrusted authors.

00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:14.570
We also covered various
online resources

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:18.150
that host exploit code for
publicly-known vulnerabilities

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.950
as well as offline resources that
do not require an Internet connection.

00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:28.895
Finally we covered a scenario that shows
how such online resources can be used

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.129
to find public exploits
for software versions

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.262
discovered during the
enumeration phase of a target.
