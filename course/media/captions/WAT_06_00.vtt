Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

00:00:06.326 --> 00:00:10.866
One of the most important features
of awell-defended web application is

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.508
data sanitization,

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:16.433
a process in which
user input is processed,

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:21.900
removing or transforming all
dangerous characters or strings.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.433
Unsanitized data allows
an attacker to inject

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:28.233
and potentially execute malicious code.

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:33.100
When this unsanitized input
is displayed on a web page,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.833
this creates a
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:41.233
Once thought to be a
relatively low-risk vulnerability,

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:45.133
XSS today is both high-risk and prevalent,

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:49.033
allowing attackers to
inject client side scripts

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:51.833
into web pages viewed by other users.

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:56.333
Regardless of how the XSS
payload is delivered and executed,

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.900
the injected scripts run
under the context of the user

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.066
viewing the affected page.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.566
That is to say, the userâ€™s browser,

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:09.233
not the web application,
executes the XSS payload.
