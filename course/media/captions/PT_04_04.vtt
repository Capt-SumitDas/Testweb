Display Filters

00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:09.676
Now that Wireshark is capturing all
the traffic on our local network,

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:13.843
we can login to an FTP server
and inspect the traffic:

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.876
To further narrow down the
background traffic,

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:42.643
let’s make use of a display filter to
focus only on the FTP protocol.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.343
Let’s apply a display filter that
will only display FTP data,

00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:53.358
or TCP traffic on port 21.

00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:04.253
This filter worked very well. Now we can
clearly see only FTP traffic on port 21.
