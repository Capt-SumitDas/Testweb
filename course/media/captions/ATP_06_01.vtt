00:00:01.415 --> 00:00:02.433
Enumeration

00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:06.366
We are assuming that Poultry
is running Windows.

00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:10.633
We can increase our confidence by
enumerating the network with Nmap.

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:15.466
If Nmap discovers any applications,
we will enumerate them.

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:18.733
Network Enumeration

00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:23.600
To run an Nmap scan, we will
have to use ProxyChains.

00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:28.000
Network scanning with ProxyChains
will be slow so we will start with

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.666
only the top 20 ports and
expand our scope if needed.

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.366
To run Nmap through ProxyChains,
we will prepend the

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:41.500
nmap command we want
to run with proxychains.

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:45.366
We will only scan the top 20 ports,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.466
and will conduct a connect
scan with the -sT flag.

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:56.100
SOCKS proxies require a TCP connection,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.533
so we can not use half-open
or SYN scans with ProxyChains.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:06.000
Since SOCKS proxies require
a TCP connection,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.900
ICMP cannot get through either and we
must disable pinging with the -Pn flag.

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:29.266
Nmap discovered that ports
135, 139, 445, and 3389 are open.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:37.221
However, port 53 is closed, which is
commonly open on domain controllers.

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:41.600
This is most likely not the domain
controller we are looking for,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.566
but the other ports still indicate
that this is a Windows OS.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:53.200
The top 20 ports did not show
any HTTP applications running,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.100
so let’s try to “exploit” this
Windows machine

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.733
by logging in via RDP with
the credentials we discovered.
