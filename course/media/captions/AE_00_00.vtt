Antivirus Evasion

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.233
In an attempt to compromise a target
machine,

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:13.000
attackers often disable or otherwise
bypass antivirus software installed on

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
these systems.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.766
As penetration testers we must understand
and be able to mimic these techniques

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.400
in order to demonstrate this potential
threat.

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:27.033
In this module, we will discuss the
purpose of antivirus software

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.466
and outline how it is deployed in most
companies.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.966
Weâ€™ll examine various methods used to
detect malicious software 

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:39.966
and explore someof the available tools
that will allow us to bypass antivirus

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.600
software on target machines.
