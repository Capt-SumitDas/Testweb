Client-Side Attacks

00:00:03.908 --> 00:00:07.175
Client-side attack vectors
are especially insidious

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:10.408
as they exploit weaknesses
in client software,

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:14.933
such as a browser, as opposed
to exploiting server software.

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:20.300
This often involves some form of
user interaction and deception

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.833
in order for the client software
to execute malicious code.

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:28.008
These attack vectors are particularly
appealing for an attacker

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:33.641
because they do not require direct or
routable access to the victim’s machine.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:40.533
For example, imagine that an employee
inside a non-routable internal network

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:45.733
has received an email with an attachment
or a link to a malicious website.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.733
If the employee opens the attachment
or clicks on the link,

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:54.133
the content, which may be a document
or the contents of a web page,

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:59.733
is sent as input to a local application
on their machine.

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:05.500
The application will then render that
input and could execute malicious code.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.416
The employee’s machine
would then be exploited,

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:12.983
perhaps launching a remote shell
from the compromised machine

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:17.116
out through the firewall, to a
listener on the attacker’s machine.

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:20.958
In this module we will describe some
of the factors that are important

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:26.425
to consider in this type of attack and
walk through exploitation scenarios

00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:32.625
involving both malicious HTML
Applications and Microsoft Word documents.
