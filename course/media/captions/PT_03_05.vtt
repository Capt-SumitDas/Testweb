Powercat File Transfers

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:08.282
Let’s take a look at how to use
Powercat to transfer itself

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:12.649
from Bob to Alice as a way
to demonstrate file transfers.

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:18.263
First, we run a Netcat listener
on Alice’s computer.

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:22.601
Next, we will invoke powercat
on Bob’s computer.

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.068
The -c option specifies client mode

00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:33.534
and we provide it with the remote
IP address and port to connect to.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.120
We then use the -i option
and indicate the local file

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.720
that will be transferred to
the remote listener.

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:47.034
Finally, Alice will kill
the Netcat process

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:49.434
and check that the file
has been received:

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.953
Great, our file was
transferred successfully.
