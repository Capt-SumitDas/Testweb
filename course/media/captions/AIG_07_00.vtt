Wrapping Up

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.933
There is never one “best” tool
for any given situation,

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.966
especially since many tools in Kali Linux

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.766
overlap in function.

00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:18.300
It’s always best to familiarize yourself
with as many tools as possible,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.433
learn their nuances and whenever possible,

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:25.766
measure the results to understand
what’s happening behind the scenes.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:32.833
In some cases, the “best” tool is the one
held by the most experienced practitioner.
