00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:05.466
apt-cache search and apt show

00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:09.400
The apt-cache search command displays 
much of the information stored

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.166
in the internal cached package database.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:17.366
For example, let’s say we would like to 
install the pure-ftpd application.

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:21.166
The first thing we have to do is to find 
out whether or not the application

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.566
is present in the Kali Linux 
repositories.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:30.433
To do this, we simply provide the search 
term to apt-cache search.

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:33.500
The output reveals that the application 
is, in fact, 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.966
present in the Kali repository.

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:40.933
There are also a few authentication 
extensions for the pure-ftpd application

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.366
that we could install if needed.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:48.000
Interestingly enough, the resource-agents 
package is showing up in our search

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.866
even though its name does not contain the 
“pure-ftpd” keyword. 

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:57.400
This is because apt-cache search looks 
for the requested keyword 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.800
in the package’s description rather than 
in the package name itself.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.266
To confirm that the resource-agents 
package description really contains

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:11.600
the “pure-ftpd” keyword, pass the package 
name to apt show.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:18.800
The output reveals why the 
resource-agents application was 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.266
mysteriously showing up in the previous 
search for pure-ftpd.
