wget

00:00:02.848 --> 00:00:05.748
The wget command, which we
use extensively,

00:00:05.773 --> 00:00:10.373
downloads files using the the
HTTP and FTP protocols.

00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:14.840
Wget can be used along with the
dash-capital-O switch

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.273
to save the destination file with
a different name on the local machine.

00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:27.331
Wget has many features and can do
far more than simply download files.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.573
Refer to its documentation for
more information.
