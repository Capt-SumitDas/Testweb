Powercat Reverse Shells

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:07.367
The reverse shell process is
similar to what we’ve already seen.

00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:10.717
We begin with the Netcat
listener on Alice’s machine.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.950
Next, Bob will use powercat
to send a reverse shell.

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:25.967
In this example, the -e option specifies
the application to execute

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:28.601
once a connection is made
to the listening port.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:33.834
After hitting enter, Alice’s Netcat
listener will receive the shell.

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:41.501
As expected, we received a
reverse shell with powercat.
